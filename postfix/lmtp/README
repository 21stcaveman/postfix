README

The starting point for this work was the original LMTP patch,
lmtp-19990427.tar.gz, found in the experimental directory on the
Postfix mirror ftp sites.  Without this original work by Philip A.
Prindeville, I probably wouldn't have taken the time to dive into
this issue.  Fortunately, this individual's work gave me a good 
starting point to learn about LMTP, and Postfix in general.

First, in the Postfix source directory, apply the following patches:

  patch -p0 < lmtp/makefile-patch
  patch -p0 < lmtp/global-patch
  patch -p0 < lmtp/man-patch

Then compile and install Postfix as usual.  There really isn't 
anything OS specific so it should compile without problems.

NOTE: Previously this patch would do a pipe to an external command
      to perform local delivery.  That is no longer the case!  This
      version now requires the "spawn" service be defined.  See
      README.local for details.

The other way to use this lmtp service is to talk to a remote LMTP
server.  An example of this would be if an MX host is to insert
incoming mail directly into a message store that supports the LMTP
protocol.  This is described in README.inet.

The file CHANGES lists some of the changes that have been made
since lmtp-19990427.tar.gz, and TODO discusses some thoughts
that are currently floating around.
