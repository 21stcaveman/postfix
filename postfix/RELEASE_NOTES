This is the Postfix 2.12 (experimental) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-2.11.x where 2=major
release number, 11=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-2.12-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 2.10 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-2.11
before proceeding.

====================================

Support to change arbitrary hard delivery errors into soft errors
and vice versa, or to replace the descriptive text in non-delivery
notifications. This was originally implemented for sites that want
to bounce mail when no remote SMTP server supports STARTTLS.

This feature is implemented as a filter that replaces the three-number
enhanced status code and descriptive text in Postfix delivery agent
bounce/defer messages. Note: this will not override "soft_bounce=yes".

The following example turns specific soft TLS errors into hard
errors, by overriding the first number in the enhanced status code.

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    smtp_bounce_defer_filter = pcre:/etc/postfix/smtp_ndr_filter

/etc/postfix/smtp_ndr_filter:
    /^4(\.\d+\.\d+ TLS is required, but host \S+ refused to start TLS: .+)/ 5$1
    /^4(\.\d+\.\d+ TLS is required, but was not offered by host .+)/ 5$1

This feature is supported in the lmtp(8), local(8), pipe(8), smtp(8)
and virtual(8) delivery agents. That is, all delivery agents that
actually deliver mail. 

This feature will not be supported in the error(8) or retry(8) dummy
delivery agents, because lots of things would break.

The new main.cf parameters and default values are:

    default_bounce_defer_filter =
    lmtp_bounce_defer_filter = $default_bounce_defer_filter
    local_bounce_defer_filter = $default_bounce_defer_filter
    pipe_bounce_defer_filter = $default_bounce_defer_filter
    smtp_bounce_defer_filter = $default_bounce_defer_filter
    virtual_bounce_defer_filter = $default_bounce_defer_filter

See the postconf(5) manpage for more details.
