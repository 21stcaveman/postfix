This is the Postfix 3.1 (experimental) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-3.0.x where 3=major
release number, 0=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-3.1-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 2.11 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-3.0
before proceeding.

===================================

postscreen support for the TTL of DNSBL and DNSWL lookup results
----------------------------------------------------------------

Historically, the default setting "postscreen_dnsbl_ttl = 1h" assumes
that a "not found" result from a DNSBL server will be valid for one
hour.  This may have been adequate five years ago when postscreen
was first implemented, but nowadays, that one hour can result in
missed opportunities to block new spambots.

To address this, postscreen now respects the TTL of DNSBL "not
found" replies, as well as the TTL of DNSWL replies (both "found"
and "not found").  The TTL for a "not found" reply is determined
according to RFC 2308 (the TTL of an SOA record in the reply).

Support for DNSBL or DNSWL reply TTL values is controlled by two
configuration parameters:

postscreen_dnsbl_min_ttl (default: 60 seconds).

    This parameter specifies a minimum for the amount of time that
    a DNSBL or DNSWL result will be cached in the postscreen_cache_map.
    This prevents an excessive number of postscreen cache updates
    when a DNSBL or DNSWL server specifies a very small reply TTL.

postscreen_dnsbl_max_ttl (default: $postscreen_dnsbl_ttl or 1 hour)

    This parameter specifies a maximum for the amount of time that
    a DNSBL or DNSWL result will be cached in the postscreen_cache_map.
    This prevents cache pollution when a DNSBL or DNSWL server
    specifies a very large reply TTL.

The postscreen_dnsbl_ttl parameter is now obsolete, and has become
a default value for the new postscreen_dnsbl_max_ttl parameter.

Destination-independent delivery rate delay
-------------------------------------------

Support to enforce a destination-independent delay between email
deliveries.  The following example inserts 20 seconds of delay
between deliveries with the SMTP transport, limiting the delivery
rate to at most three messages per minute.

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    smtp_transport_rate_delay = 20s

For details, see the description of default_transport_rate_delay
and transport_transport_rate_delay in the postconf(5) manpage.
