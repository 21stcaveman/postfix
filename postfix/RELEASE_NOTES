The stable Postfix release is called postfix-2.10.x where 2=major
release number, 10=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-2.11-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 2.9 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-2.10
before proceeding.

====================================

Preliminary LMDB support by Howard Chu. This implementation has
unexpected limitations that don't exist with other Postfix databases,
and therefore the code is "snapshot only", i.e. it will not be part
of the stable release without further changes to the Postfix LMDB
client or the Postfix dictionary API.  See LMDB_README for details.
