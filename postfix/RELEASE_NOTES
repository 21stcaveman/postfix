This is the Postfix 2.12 (experimental) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-2.11.x where 2=major
release number, 11=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-2.12-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 2.10 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-2.11
before proceeding.

Major changes with snapshot 20140316
====================================

Preliminary support to change arbitrary hard delivery errors into
soft errors and vice versa, originally implemented for sites that
want to bounce mail when a remote SMTP server does not support
STARTTLS.

This feature is implemented as a filter that replaces the three-number
enhanced status code and descriptive text in Postfix delivery agent
bounce/defer messages.

The following example turns specific soft TLS errors into hard
errors, by overriding the first number in the enhanced status code.

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    smtp_bounce_defer_filter = pcre:/etc/postfix/smtp_ndr_filter

/etc/postfix/smtp_ndr_filter:
    /^4(\.\d+\.\d+ TLS is required, but host \S+ refused to start TLS: .+)/ 5$1
    /^4(\.\d+\.\d+ TLS is required, but was not offered by host .+)/ 5$1

Support is currently limited to the lmtp(8), pipe(8), smtp(8) and
virtual(8) delivery agents. The new main.cf parameters and default
values are:

    default_bounce_defer_filter =
    lmtp_bounce_defer_filter = $default_bounce_defer_filter
    pipe_bounce_defer_filter = $default_bounce_defer_filter
    smtp_bounce_defer_filter = $default_bounce_defer_filter
    virtual_bounce_defer_filter = $default_bounce_defer_filter

See the postconf(5) manpage for more details.  Support for local(8)
and qmgr(8) will be added as time is available.
