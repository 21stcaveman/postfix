In the text below, incompatible changes are labeled with the Postfix
snapshot that introduced the change. If you upgrade from a later
Postfix version, then you do not have to worry about that particular
incompatibility.

Official Postfix releases are called a.b.c where a=major release
number, b=minor release number, c=patchlevel.  Snapshot releases
are now called a.b.c-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date
(yyyy=year, mm=month, dd=day).  The mail_release_date configuration
parameter contains the release date (both for official release and
snapshot release).  Patches change the patchlevel and the release
date. Snapshots change only the release date, unless they include
the same bugfixes as a patch release.

Incompatible changes with Postfix snapshot 2.0.1-20030112
=========================================================

The Postfix build procedure now uses the pcre-config utility (part
of PCRE version 3) to find out the pathnames of the PCRE include
file and object library, instead of probing /usr/include and/or
/usr/lib. To build with PCRE version 2 support you will have to
specify pathnames as described in PCRE_README. To build without
PCRE support, specify:  make Makefiles CCARGS="-DNO_PRCE".

Incompatible changes with Postfix snapshot 2.0.0-20030104
=========================================================

This release adds the new proxymap service (table lookup via a
proxy process) to the master.cf file. If you get warnings about
problems connecting to the proxymap service, then you did not
properly upgrade Postfix.

Major changes with Postfix snapshot 2.0.0-20030104
==================================================

This release introduces the proxymap service for Postfix lookup
table access. This can be used to overcome chroot restrictions in
the Postfix SMTP server (specify proxy:unix:passwd.byname for
password file lookup through the proxymap server) and can be used
to consolidate the number of open tables by sharing one open table
among multiple processes (specify proxy:mysql:/file/name to avoid
"too many connections" conditions). The proxy_read_maps parameter
specifies what maps are approved for access via the proxy service
(only map references starting with "proxy:" are considered approved).

Multi-server daemons (servers that accept simultaneous connections
from multiple clients) will now stop accepting new connections
after serving $max_use clients. This allows multi-server daemons
to automatically restart even on busy mail systems.

Clients of multi-server daemons such as trivial-rewrite and the
new proxymap service now automatically disconnect after $ipc_ttl
seconds of activity (default: 1000s). This allows multi-server
daemons to automatically restart even on busy mail systems.

Incompatible changes with Postfix snapshot 1.1.11-trace-20021119
================================================================

After upgrading an existing system you must use "postfix reload".
This is because many internal protocols have changed.

The file format of bounce/defer logfiles has changed from the old
one-line ad-hoc format to a more structured multi-line format. For
backwards compatibility, Postfix now creates bounce/defer logfile
entries that contain both the old and the new format, so that you
can go back to an older Postfix release without losing information.
Old Postfix versions will warn about malformed logfile entries,
but should work properly. To disable backwards compatibility specify
"backwards_bounce_logfile_compatibility = no" in main.cf.

The behavior of "sendmail -v" has changed. One -v option now sends
an email report with the status of each delivery attempt.  Multiple
-v options behave as before: turn on verbose logging in the sendmail
and postdrop commands.

The Postfix upgrade procedure will add two new services to your
master.cf file: "trace" and "verify". These servers can run inside
a chroot jail, have no interaction with users, and don't talk to
the network.

Major changes with Postfix snapshot 1.1.11-trace-20021119
=========================================================

New sender address verification blocks mail from addresses that
are not deliverable.  This is turned on with the reject_unverified_sender
UCE restriction. Addresses are verified by probing, that is, by
sending mail that is not actually delivered (SMTP interruptus).
Detailed information is in the SENDER_VERIFICATION_README file
and sample-verify.cf.

Address verification uses the new "verify" daemon that maintains
a database. The necessary entry is automatically added to master.cf
when you upgrade.

New "sendmail -bv" option. Postfix probes the specified recipient
addresses without actually delivering mail, and sends back an email
delivery report.  This is useful for testing address rewriting and
address routing of both envelope and header addresses. This feature
currently does not access or update the sender address verification
database.

Improved "sendmail -v" behavior. Postfix delivers mail as usual,
and emails a report of all the delivery attempts to the originator.

Bounce reports now show the original recipient information in
addition to the final recipient that was already available.

Both "sendmail -bv" and "sendmail -v" use the new "trace" daemon
that is automatically added to master.cf when you upgrade.
