The stable Postfix release is called postfix-2.9.x where 2=major
release number, 9=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-2.10-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 2.8 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-2.9
before proceeding.

Major changes with snapshot 20120422
====================================

This release adds support to turn off the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2
protocols.  Introduced with OpenSSL version 1.0.1, these are known
to cause inter-operability problems with for example hotmail.

The radical workaround is to temporarily turn off problematic
protocols globally:

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    smtp_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !TLSv1.1, !TLSv1.2
    smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !TLSv1.1, !TLSv1.2

    smtpd_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !TLSv1.1, !TLSv1.2
    smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !TLSv1.1, !TLSv1.2

However, it may be better to temporarily turn off problematic
protocols for broken sites only:

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    smtp_tls_policy_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/tls_policy

/etc/postfix/tls_policy:
    example.com         may protocols=!SSLv2:!TLSv1.1:!TLSv1.2

Important:

- Note the use of ":" instead of comma or space. Also, note that
  there is NO space around the "=" in "protocols=".

- The smtp_tls_policy_maps lookup key must match the "next-hop"
  destination that is given to the Postfix SMTP client. If you
  override the next-hop destination with transport_maps, relayhost,
  sender_dependent_relayhost_maps, or otherwise, you need to specify
  the same destination for the smtp_tls_policy_maps lookup key.

Major changes with snapshot 20120306
====================================

New master "-w" option, to wait for daemon process initialization
to complete. This feature returns an error exit status if master
daemon initialization fails, or if it does not complete in a
reasonable amount of time. The exit status is used by "postfix
start" to provide more accurate information to system start-up
scripts.

Major changes with snapshot 20120303
====================================

New control for "permit" logging in smtpd_mumble_restrictions.
Specify "smtpd_log_access_permit_actions = static:all" to log all
"permit"-style actions, or specify a list of explicit names.  More
details are in the postconf(5) manpage.
