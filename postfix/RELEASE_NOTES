The stable Postfix release is called postfix-2.2.x where 2=major
release number, 2=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-2.3-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

Incompatibility with Postfix 2.1 and earlier
============================================

If you upgrade from Postfix 2.1 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-2.2
before proceeding.

Incompatibility with snapshot 20050328
======================================

After you upgrade from Postfix 2.2 or 2.3 you need to execute
"postfix reload", otherwise you will keep running the old Postfix
queue manager, which gives no special treatment to the enhanced
status codes that it receives from Postfix delivery agents.

Major changes with snapshot 20050328
====================================

This release introduces support for RFC 3463 enhanced status codes.
For example, status code 5.1.1 means "recipient unknown". Postfix
recognizes enhanced status codes in remote server replies, generates
enhanced status codes while handling email, and reports enhanced
status codes in non-delivery notifications.  This improves the user
interaction with mail clients that hide the text of error messages
from users.

You can, but don't have to, specify RFC 3463 enhanced status codes
in the output from commands that receive mail from a pipe. If a
command terminates with non-zero exit status, and an enhanced status
code is present at the beginning of the command output, then that
status code takes precedence over the non-zero exit status.

You can, but don't have to, specify RFC 3463 enhanced status codes
in Postfix access maps, header/body_checks REJECT actions, or in
RBL replies.  For example:

    REJECT 5.7.1 You can't go here from there

The status 5.7.1 means "no authorization, message refused", and is
the default for access maps, header/body_checks REJECT actions, and
for RBL replies.

If you specify your own enhanced status code, the Postfix SMTP
server will automatically change a leading '5' digit (hard error)
into '4' where appropriate.  This is needed, for example, with
soft_bounce=yes.
