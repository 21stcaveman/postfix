The stable Postfix release is called postfix-2.10.x where 2=major
release number, 10=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-2.11-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 2.9 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-2.10
before proceeding.

Major changes with snapshot 20130319
====================================

Postfix support for LMDB databases is withdrawn due to the existence
of a hard limit (an "out of storage" failure mode that cannot be
resolved by increasing the database size).

Postfix may support LMDB again when without exception all "out of
storage" failure modes are resolved by increasing the database size.

Major changes with snapshot 20130315
====================================

LMDB support by Howard Chu. This implementation has unexpected
failure modes that don't exist with other Postfix databases, so
don't just yet abandon CDB. See LMDB_README for details.
