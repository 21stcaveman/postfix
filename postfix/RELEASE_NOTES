The stable Postfix release is called postfix-2.6.x where 2=major
release number, 6=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-2.7-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 2.5 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-2.6
before proceeding.

Incompatibility with snapshot 20090807
======================================

With some domain names, NS record lookups always fail while other
lookups always succeed (and may even return NS records as additional
information).  This anomaly could be used by evil elements to skip
Postfix check_{client,helo,sender,recipient}_ns_access checks,
because these apply only to domains that are known in the DNS.

To address this specific problem, check_{client,etc}_ns_access now
requires that a known-in-DNS domain name (or parent thereof) resolves
to at least one name server IP address.

For consistency, check_{client,etc}_mx_access now requires that a
known-in-DNS domain name resolves to at least one mail server IP
address.

In addition, reject_unknown_helo_hostname, reject_unknown_sender_domain
and reject_unknown_recipient_domain now require that an MX record
resolves to at least one IP address.  Until now, the existence of
an MX record was sufficient.

Keep in mind that these measures provide no hard assurances. There
is little to stop an uncooperative DNS server from lying, especially
when the owner of the domain has no intention to receive email.

Incompatibility with snapshot 20090606
======================================

The "postmulti -e destroy" command no longer attempts to remove
files that are created AFTER "postmulti -e create".  It still works
as expected immediately after creating an instance by mistake.
Trying to automatically remove other files is too risky because
Postfix-owned directories are by design not trusted.

Major changes with snapshot 20090606
====================================

Support for header checks on Milter-generated message headers.  This
can be used, for example, to control mail flow with Milter-generated
headers with indicators for badness or goodness. For details, see
the postconf(5) section for "milter_header_checks". Currently, all
header_checks features are implemented except PREPEND.
