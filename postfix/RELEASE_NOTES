This is the Postfix 2.12 (experimental) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-2.11.x where 2=major
release number, 11=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-2.12-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 2.10 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-2.11
before proceeding.

Major changes with snapshot 20140321
====================================

Delivery status filter support, to replace the delivery status codes
and explanatory text of successful or unsuccessful deliveries.  This
was originally implemented for sites that want to turn certain soft
delivery errors into hard delivery errors, but it can also be used
to censor out information from delivery confirmation reports.

This feature is implemented as a filter that replaces the three-number
enhanced status code and descriptive text in Postfix delivery agent
success, bounce, or defer messages. Note: this will not override
"soft_bounce=yes", and this will not change a successful delivery
status into an unsuccessful status or vice versa.

The first example turns specific soft TLS errors into hard
errors, by overriding the first number in the enhanced status code.

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    smtp_delivery_status_filter = pcre:/etc/postfix/smtp_dsn_filter

/etc/postfix/smtp_dsn_filter:
    /^4(\.\d+\.\d+ TLS is required, but host \S+ refused to start TLS: .+)/ 5$1
    /^4(\.\d+\.\d+ TLS is required, but was not offered by host .+)/ 5$1

The second example removes the destination command name and file
name from local(8) successful delivery reports, so that they will
not be reported when a sender requests confirmation of delivery.

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    local_delivery_status_filter = pcre:/etc/postfix/local_dsn_filter

/etc/postfix/local_dsn_filter:
    /^(2\S+ delivered to file).+/    $1
    /^(2\S+ delivered to command).+/ $1

This feature is supported in the lmtp(8), local(8), pipe(8), smtp(8)
and virtual(8) delivery agents. That is, all delivery agents that
actually deliver mail. 

The new main.cf parameters and default values are:

    default_delivery_status_filter =
    lmtp_delivery_status_filter = $default_delivery_status_filter
    local_delivery_status_filter = $default_delivery_status_filter
    pipe_delivery_status_filter = $default_delivery_status_filter
    smtp_delivery_status_filter = $default_delivery_status_filter
    virtual_delivery_status_filter = $default_delivery_status_filter

See the postconf(5) manpage for more details.
