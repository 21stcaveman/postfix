The stable Postfix release is called postfix-2.2.x where 2=major
release number, 2=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-2.3-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

See RELEASE_NOTES-2.2 for changes introduced during the development
of Postfix version 2.2.

Incompatible changes with snapshot 20050327
===========================================

local(8) and virtual(8) now handle the same errors in the same way.
This means that local(8) will defer some mail that it older versions
would bounce, and that virtual(8) will bounce some mail that older
versions would defer.

Specifically, error codes EACCES, EAGAIN, ESTALE are soft (4.2.0)
errors, ENOSPC is a soft (4.3.0) error, EDQUOT and EFBIG are hard
(5.2.2) errors, and everything else is a hard (5.2.0) error.

Major changes with snapshot 20050327
====================================

This release introduces support for RFC 1893 enhanced status codes.
For example, status code "5.1.1" means "recipient unknown". Postfix
recognizes enhanced status codes in remote server replies, and
generates enhanced status codes when it responds to mail delivery
requests. This improves the communication with mail clients that
hide error messages from users.

You can, but don't have to, specify RFC 1893 enhanced status codes
in Postfix access maps or header/body_checks. Example:

    REJECT 5.7.1 You can't go here from there

(5.7.1 means "no authorization, message refused").  Enhanced status
code support is also available in RBL reply templates.

If you do specify an enhanced status code, Postfix will automatically
change the first digit into a '4' or '5' as appropriate.
