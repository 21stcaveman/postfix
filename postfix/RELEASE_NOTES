The stable Postfix release is called postfix-2.8.x where 2=major
release number, 8=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-2.9-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 2.7 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-2.8
before proceeding.

===========================================

The VSTREAM error flags are now split into separate read and write
error flags. As a result of this change, all programs that use
VSTREAMs MUST be recompiled.
