None.

Major changes with postfix-beta-19990122-pl01:
==============================================

- Restrict who may use ETRN and what domains may be specified.
Example:  "smtpd_etrn_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject".

- BIFF notifications.  For compatibility reasons this feature is
on by default.  Specify "biff = no" in main.cf if your machine has
lots of shell users.

- With "soft_bounce = yes", defer delivery instead of bouncing
mail. This is a safety net for configuration errors with delivery
agents. It has no effect on errors in virtual maps, canonical maps,
or in junk mail restrictions.

- Specify "owner_request_special = no" to turn off special treatment
of owner-foo and foo-request addresses.

Incompatible changes with postfix-beta-19990122:
================================================

- The syntax of the transport table has changed. An entry like:

	customer.org	smtp:[gateway.customer.org]

  no longer forwards mail for anything.customer.org. For that you
  need to specify:

	customer.org	smtp:[gateway.customer.org]
	.customer.org	smtp:[gateway.customer.org]

  This change makes tranport tables more compatible with
  sendmail mailer tables.

- The format of syslog records has changed. A client is now always
logged as hostname[address]; the pickup daemon logs queue file uid
and sender address.

Major changes with postfix-beta-19990122:
=========================================

- Junk mail restrictions can now be postoned to the RCPT TO command.
Specify: "smtpd_recipient_restrictions = reject_maps_rbl...".

- More flexible interface for delivery to e.g., cyrus IMAP without
need for PERL scripts to munge recipient addresses. In addition to
$sender, $nexthop and $recipient, the pipe mailer now also supports
$user, $extension and $mailbox.

- New mail now has precedence over deferred mail, plus some other
tweaks to make bulk mail go faster. But it ain't no cure for massive
network outages.

- Watchdog timer for systems that cause the Postfix queue manager
to lock up, so it recovers without human intervention.

- Delivery to qmail-style maildir files, which is good for NFS
environments.  Specify "home_mailbox = Maildir/", or specify
/file/name/ in aliases or in .forward files. The trailing / is
required to turn on maildir delivery.

- Incremental updates of aliases and maps. Specify "postmap -i
mapname" and it will read new entries from stdin. 

- Newaliases will now update more than one alias database.
Specify the names with the main.cf "alias_database" parameter.

- Address masquerading exceptions to prevent users from being
masqueraded. Specify "masquerade_exceptions = root".

- A pipelined SMTP client. Deliveries to Postfix, qmail, LSOFT,
zmailer, and exim (once it's fixed) speed up by some 30% for short
messages with one recipient, with more for multi-recipient mails.

- Hook for local delivery to "|command" via the smrsh restricted
shell, to restrict what commands may be used in .forward etc. files.
Specify "local_command_shell = /some/where/smrsh -c".
