This is the Postfix 3.4 (experimental) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-3.3.x where 3=major
release number, 3=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-3.4-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 3.2 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-3.3
before proceeding.

Incompatble change with snapshot 20180701
=========================================

To avoid performance loss under load, the tlsproxy(8) daemon now
requires a zero process limit in master.cf (this setting is provided
with the default master.cf file). As tlsproxy(8) processes become
too busy handling TLS connections, more processes will automatically
be added. By default, a tlsproxy(8) process will retire after several
hours.

To set the tlsproxy process limit to zero:

# postconf -F tlsproxy/unix/process_limit=0
# postfix reload

Major changes with snapshot 20180617
====================================

Preliminary Postfix SMTP client support for multiple deliveries per
TLS-encrypted connection. This is primarily to improve mail delivery
performance for destinations that throttle clients when they don't
combine deliveries.

This feature is enabled with "smtp_tls_connection_reuse=yes" in
main.cf, or with "tls_connection_reuse=yes" in smtp_tls_policy_maps.
It supports all Postfix TLS security levels including dane and
dane-only.

The implementation of TLS connection reuse relies on the same
scache(8) service as used for delivering plaintext SMTP mail, the
same tlsproxy(8) daemon as used by the postscreen(8) service for
inbound connections, and relies on the same hints from the qmgr(8)
daemon. It reuses the configuration parameters described in
CONNECTION_CACHE_README.

The following illustrates how TLS connections are reused:

    Initial plaintext SMTP handshake:
      smtp(8) -> remote SMTP server

    Reused SMTP/TLS connection, or new SMTP/TLS connection:
      smtp(8) -> tlsproxy(8) -> remote SMTP server

    Cached SMTP/TLS connection:
      scache(8) -> tlsproxy(8) -> remote SMTP server

There are a few refinements planned:

- Log the TLS properties every time a connection is reused.
  Currently, the properties are logged when a TLS session is created.
