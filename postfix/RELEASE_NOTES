The official Postfix release is called 2.1.x where 2=major release
number, 1=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  Snapshot releases
are now called 2.2-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date
(yyyy=year, mm=month, dd=day).  The mail_release_date configuration
parameter contains the release date (both for official release and
snapshot release).  Patches are issued for the official release
and change the patchlevel and the release date. Patches are never
issued for snapshot releases.

[nothing to report here, except great relief that 2.1 is frozen]
