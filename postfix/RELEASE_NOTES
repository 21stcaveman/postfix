This is the Postfix 3.6 (experimental) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-3.5.x where 3=major
release number, 5=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-3.6-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 3.4 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-3.5
before proceeding.

Major changes with snapshot 20201205
====================================

Support for threaded bounces. This allows mail readers to present
a non-delivery notification in the same email thread as the original
message.

Unfortunately, this also makes it easy for users to mistakenly delete
the whole email thread (all related messages), instead of deleting
only the non-delivery notification.

To enable, specify "enable_threaded_bounces = yes".

Major changes with snapshot 20201025
====================================

Fine-grained control over the envelope sender address for submission
with the Postfix sendmail (or postdrop) commands.

The local_login_sender_maps parameter (default: static:*) specifies
a list of lookup tables that are searched by the UNIX login name, and
that return a list of allowed envelope sender patterns separated by
space or comma. The default is backwards-compatible: every user may
specify any sender envelope address.

When no UNIX login name is available, the Postfix postdrop command
will prepend "uid:" to the numerical UID and use that instead.

This feature ignores address extensions in the user-specified
envelope sender address.

Besides the special pattern "*" which allows any sender address,
there are "<>" which matches an empty sender address, and the
"@domain" wilcard pattern. More information about those can be found
in the postconf(5) manpage.

Example:

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    # Allow root and postfix full control, anyone else can only
    # send mail as themselves. Use "uid:" followed by the numerical
    # UID when the UID has no entry in the UNIX password file.
    local_login_sender_maps =
        inline:{ { root = *}, { postfix = * } },
        pcre:/etc/postfix/login_senders

/etc/postfix/login_senders:
   # Allow both the bare username and the user@domain forms.
    /(.+)/ $1 $1@example.com

Major changes with snapshot 20201003
====================================

The Postfix build system will no longer automatically disable DNSSEC
support when it determines that Postfix will use libc-musl. Instead,
Postfix will rely on the new dnssec_probe feature to determine at
runtime if DNSSEC validation is available. DNSSEC support may be
broken for reasons other than compatibility issues with the libc
implementation.

Major changes with snapshot 20200930
====================================

When a Postfix process requires DNSSEC support (typically, for
Postfix DANE support), the process may do a one-time test to determine
if DNSSEC validation is available. DNSSEC support may be broken
because of local configuration, libc incompatibility, or network
infrastructure issues.

Background: DNSSEC validation is needed for Postfix DANE support;
this ensures that Postfix receives TLSA records with secure TLS
server certificate info. When DNSSEC validation is unavailable,
mail deliveries using opportunistic DANE will not be protected by
server certificate info in TLSA records, and mail deliveries using
mandatory DANE will not be made at all.

The dnssec_probe parameter specifies the DNS query type (default:
"ns") and DNS query name (default: ".") that Postfix may use to
determine whether DNSSEC validation is available. Specify an empty
value to disable this feature.

By default, a Postfix process will send a DNSSEC probe after 1) the
process made a DNS query that requested DNSSEC validation, 2) the
process did not receive a DNSSEC validated response to this query
or to an earlier query, and 3) the process did not already send a
DNSSEC probe.

When the DNSSEC probe has no response, or when the response is not
DNSSEC validated, Postfix logs a warning that DNSSEC validation may
be unavailable. Examples:

warning: DNSSEC validation may be unavailable
warning: reason: dnssec_probe 'ns:.' received a response that is not DNSSEC validated
warning: reason: dnssec_probe 'ns:.' received no response: Server failure

Incompatible change with snapshot 20200920
==========================================

Internal protocols have changed. You need to "postfix stop" before
updating, or before backing out to an earlier release, otherwise
long-running daemons (pickup, qmgr, verify, tlsproxy, postscreen)
may fail to communicate with the rest of Postfix (warnings, timeouts).

The purpose of this change is to produce better error messages, for
example, when someone configures the discard daemon as a bounce
service in master.cf, or vice versa.

This change will break third-party code that implements a
Postfix-internal protocol such as qpsmtpd. Programs that depend on
Postfix internal details are not supported.

Incompatible change with snapshot 20200705
==========================================

The minimum OpenSSL version is 1.1.1, which will reach the end
of life by 20203-09-11. 

The default digest has changed from md5 to sha256 (Postfix 3.6 with
compatibility_level >= 3). With a lower compatibility_level setting,
Postfix defaults to using md5, and logs a warning when a Postfix
configuration specifies no explicit digest type.

Export-grade Diffie-Hellman key exchange is no longer supported,
and the tlsproxy_tls_dh512_param_file parameter is ignored,

Incompatible change with snapshot 20200531
==========================================

Postfix delivery agents now log an explicit record when delegating
delivery to a different Postfix delivery agent. 

For example, with "best_mx_transport = local", an SMTP delivery
agent will now log when a recipient will be delivered locally. This
makes the delegating delivery agent visible, where it would otherwise
have remained invisible, which would complicate troubleshooting.

  postfix/smtp[pid]: queueid: passing <recipient> to transport=local

This will usually be followed by logging for an actual delivery:

  postfix/local[pid]: queueid: to=<recipient>, relay=local, ...

Other examples: the local delivery agent defers mailbox delivery
through mailbox_transport or through fallback_transport.

Major changes with snapshot 20200509
====================================

The threadsafe resolver API (res_nxxx() calls) is now the default,
not because the API is threadsafe, but because new features are
being added there.

To build old style, build with:

    make makefiles CCARGS="-DNO_RES_NCALLS..."

This is also the default for systems that are known not to support
the threadsafe resolver API, such systems that use libc-musl.

Incompatible changes with snapshot 20200416
===========================================

Security: this release disables DANE support on Linux systems with
libc-musl, because libc-musl provides no indication whether DNS
responses are authentic. This broke DANE support without a clear
explanation.
