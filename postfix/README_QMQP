Postfix QMQP server support
===========================

Postfix has preliminary server support for the QMQP protocol, so
that Postfix can be used as a backend for the Ezmlm-idx mailing
list manager. This support includes qmqp-source and qmqp-sink
programs for protocol stress testing.

Turning on the QMQP service
===========================

To enable QMQP server support on an existing Postfix system you
have to add the following line to /etc/postfix/master.cf:

628       inet  n       -       n       -       -       qmqpd


QMQP server access control
==========================

By default, the QMQP server does not accept mail from any client.
This is because the QMQP server relays mail to any destination
(the "protocol" has no provision to reject specific recipients).

To authorize QMQP clients, edit /etc/postfix/main.cf and specify
a list of client patterns.

qmqp_authorized_clients = client, client, ...

A list pattern specifies a host name, a domain name, an internet
address, or a network/mask pattern, where the mask specifies the
number of bits in the network part.  When a pattern specifies a
file name, its contents are substituted for the file name; when a
pattern is a type:name table specification, table lookup is used
instead.

Patterns are separated by whitespace and/or commas. In order to
reverse the result, precede a non-file name pattern with an
exclamation point (!).
