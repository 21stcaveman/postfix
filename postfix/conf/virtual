# 
# NAME
#        virtual - format of Postfix virtual table
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        postmap /etc/postfix/virtual
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  optional  virtual  table  specifies  redirections for
#        local and non-local recipients or  domains.  The  redirec-
#        tions  are used by the cleanup(8) daemon. The redirections
#        are recursive.
# 
#        The virtual redirection is applied only to  the  recipient
#        envelope  address,  and  does  not affect message headers.
#        Think Sendmail rule set S0, if you like. Use  canonical(5)
#        mapping  to  rewrite header and envelope addresses in gen-
#        eral.
# 
#        Normally, the file serves as input to the postmap(1)  com-
#        mand.  The result, an indexed file in dbm or db format, is
#        used for fast searching  by  the  mail  system.  After  an
#        update  it  may  take  a  minute  or  so before the change
#        becomes visible.  Issue a postfix reload command to elimi-
#        nate the delay.
# 
#        When  the  table  is provided via other means such as NIS,
#        LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are  done  as  for  ordinary
#        indexed files.
# 
#        Alternatively,  the  table  can  be provided as a regular-
#        expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
#        sions.  In  that  case, the lookups are done in a slightly
#        different way as described below.
# 
# TABLE FORMAT
#        Typical support for a virtual domain looks like  the  fol-
#        lowing:
# 
#            virtual.domain       anything (right-hand content does not matter)
#            user1@virtual.domain address1
#            user2@virtual.domain address2, address3
# 
#        With this, the SMTP server accepts mail for virtual.domain
#        and rejects mail for unknown@virtual.domain as  undeliver-
#        able.
# 
#        The  format  of  the virtual table is as follows, mappings
#        being tried in the order as listed in this manual page:
# 
#        blanks and comments
#               Blank lines are ignored,  as  are  lines  beginning
#               with `#'.
# 
#                                                                 1
# 
# VIRTUAL(5)                                             VIRTUAL(5)
# 
#        pattern result
#               When  pattern matches a mail address, replace it by
#               the corresponding result.
# 
#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
#        networked  tables  such  as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are
#        tried in the order as listed below:
# 
#        user@domain address, address, ...
#               Mail for  user@domain  is  redirected  to  address.
#               This form has the highest precedence.
# 
#        user address, address, ...
#               Mail  for  user@site  is redirected to address when
#               site is equal to $myorigin, when site is listed  in
#               $mydestination,   or   when   it   is   listed   in
#               $inet_interfaces.
# 
#               This functionality overlaps with  functionality  of
#               the local alias(5) database. The difference is that
#               virtual  mapping  can  be  applied   to   non-local
#               addresses.
# 
#        @domain address, address, ...
#               Mail  for  any  user  in  domain  is  redirected to
#               address.  This form has the lowest precedence.
# 
#        In all the above forms, when address has the form  @other-
#        domain,  the result is the same user in otherdomain.  This
#        works for the first address in the expansion only.
# 
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
#        When the search fails, and the address localpart  contains
#        the  optional recipient delimiter (e.g., user+foo@domain),
#        the search is repeated for the  unextended  address  (e.g.
#        user@domain), and the unmatched address extension is prop-
#        agated to the result of expansion. The matching order  is:
#        user+foo@domain, user@domain, user+foo, user, and @domain.
# 
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
#        This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
#        the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
#        a description of regular expression lookup  table  syntax,
#        see regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5).
# 
#        Each  pattern  is  a regular expression that is applied to
#        the entire address being looked up. Thus, user@domain mail
#        addresses  are  not  broken up into their user and @domain
#        constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken up into user and
#        foo.
# 
#        Patterns  are  applied  in  the  order as specified in the
#        table, until a pattern is found that  matches  the  search
#        string.
# 
#                                                                 2
# 
# VIRTUAL(5)                                             VIRTUAL(5)
# 
#        Results  are the same as with normal indexed file lookups,
#        with the additional feature that parenthesized  substrings
#        from  the pattern can be interpolated as $1, $2 and so on.
# 
# BUGS
#        The table format does not understand quoting  conventions.
