# LDAP_TABLE(5)                                       LDAP_TABLE(5)
# 
# NAME
#        ldap_table - Postfix LDAP client configuration
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        postmap -q "string" ldap:/etc/postfix/filename
# 
#        postmap -q - ldap:/etc/postfix/filename <inputfile
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  Postfix  mail system uses optional tables for address
#        rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in dbm
#        or db format.
# 
#        Alternatively,  lookup  tables  can  be  specified as LDAP
#        databases.  In order to use LDAP lookups, define  an  LDAP
#        source as a lookup table in main.cf, for example:
#            alias_maps = ldap:/etc/ldap-aliases.cf
# 
#        The  file /etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf has the same format
#        as the Postfix main.cf file, and can specify  the  parame-
#        ters  described  below.  An example is given at the end of
#        this manual.
# 
#        For details about LDAP SSL and STARTTLS, see  the  section
#        on SSL and STARTTLS below.
# 
# BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
#        For  backwards  compatibility  LDAP parameters can also be
#        defined in main.cf.  In order to do that, specify as  LDAP
#        source  a  name  that doesn't begin with a slash or a dot.
#        The LDAP parameters will then be accessible  as  the  name
#        you've  given the source in its definition, an underscore,
#        and the name of the parameter.  For example, if the map is
#        specified  as "ldap:ldapsource", the "server_host" parame-
#        ter  below  would  be  defined  in   main.cf   as   "ldap-
#        source_server_host".
# 
#        Note:  with  this form, the passwords for the LDAP sources
#        are written in main.cf, which is normally  world-readable.
#        Support  for this form will be removed in a future Postfix
#        version.
# 
# LIST MEMBERSHIP
#        When using  LDAP  to  store  lists  such  as  $mynetworks,
#        $mydestination,   $relay_domains,   $local_recipient_maps,
#        etc., it is important to understand that  the  table  must
#        store each list member as a separate key. The table lookup
#        verifies the *existence* of the key.  See  "Postfix  lists
#        versus  tables" in the DATABASE_README document for a dis-
#        cussion.
# 
#        Do NOT create tables that return the full list of  domains
#        in  $mydestination or $relay_domains etc., or IP addresses
#        in $mynetworks.
# 
#        DO create tables with each matching item as a key and with
#        an arbitrary value. With LDAP databases it is not uncommon
#        to return the key itself.
# 
#        For example, NEVER do this in a map  defining  $mydestina-
#        tion:
#            query_filter = domain=*
#            result_attribute = domain
# 
#        Do this instead:
#            query_filter = domain=%s
#            result_attribute = domain
# 
# GENERAL LDAP PARAMETERS
#        In  the  text below, default values are given in parenthe-
#        ses.  Note: don't use quotes in these variables; at least,
#        not  until  the  Postfix configuration routines understand
#        how to deal with quoted strings.
# 
#        server_host (default: localhost)
#               The name of the host running the LDAP server,  e.g.
#                   server_host = ldap.your.com
# 
#               Depending  on the LDAP client library you're using,
#               it should be possible to specify  multiple  servers
#               here,  with the library trying them in order should
#               the first one fail. It should also be  possible  to
#               give  each  server  in  the  list  a different port
#               (overriding server_port below), by naming them like
#                   server_host = ldap.your.com:1444
# 
#               With OpenLDAP, a (list of) LDAP URLs can be used to
#               specify both the hostname(s) and the port(s):
#                   server_host = ldap://ldap.your.com:1444
# 
#               All LDAP URLs accepted by the OpenLDAP library  are
#               supported,  including  connections over UNIX domain
#               sockets, and LDAP SSL (the last one  provided  that
#               OpenLDAP was compiled with support for SSL):
#                   server_host = ldapi://%2Fsome%2Fpath
#                   server_host = ldaps://ldap.your.com:636
# 
#        server_port (default: 389)
#               The port the LDAP server listens on, e.g.
#                   server_port = 778
# 
#        search_base (No default; you must configure this)
#               The RFC2253 base DN at which to conduct the search,
#               e.g.
#                   search_base = dc=your, dc=com
# 
#        timeout (default: 10 seconds)
#               The number of seconds a search can take before tim-
#               ing out, e.g.
#                   timeout = 5
# 
#        query_filter (default: mailacceptinggeneralid=%s)
#               The  RFC2254  filter  used to search the directory,
#               where %s is a substitute for the address Postfix is
#               trying to resolve, e.g.
#                   query_filter = (&(mail=%s)(paid_up=true))
# 
#               This  parameter  supports  the following '%' expan-
#               sions:
# 
#               %s     This is replaced by the input key. RFC  2254
#                      quoting  is used to make sure that the input
#                      key does not add unexpected  metacharacters.
# 
#               %u     When the input key is an address of the form
#                      user@domain, %u  is  replaced  by  the  (RFC
#                      2254)  quoted  local part of the address. If
#                      no domain is specified, %u  is  replaced  by
#                      the entire search string.
# 
#               %d     When the input key is an address of the form
#                      user@domain, %d  is  replaced  by  the  (RFC
#                      2254)  quoted  domain  part  of the address.
#                      When the input key has no domain  qualifier,
#                      %d  is replaced by the entire search string.
# 
#               The "domain" parameter described below  limits  the
#               input  keys  to addresses in matching domains. When
#               the "domain" parameter is non-empty,  LDAP  queries
#               for  unqualified  addresses  or  addresses  in non-
#               matching  domains  are  suppressed  and  return  no
#               results.
# 
#               NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the query filter.
# 
#        result_filter (default: %s)
#               Format  template applied to result attributes. Sup-
#               ports the same expansions as the query_filter,  and
#               can  be  easily  used  to append (or prepend) text.
#               This parameter supports the  following  '%'  expan-
#               sions:
# 
#               %s     This  is replaced by the value of the result
#                      attribute.
# 
#               %u     When the result attribute is an  address  of
#                      the  form  user@domain, %u is replaced local
#                      part of the address, if the result attribute
#                      is unqualified, %u is replaced by the entire
#                      attribute value.
# 
#               %d     When a result attribute is an address of the
#                      form  user@domain,  %d  is  replaced  by the
#                      domain part of the attribute value.   If  an
#                      attribute   value   is   unqualified  %d  is
#                      replaced by the entire attribute value.
# 
#               For  example,  using  "result_filter  =  smtp:[%s]"
#               allows one to use a mailHost attribute as the basis
#               of a transport(5) table. After applying the  result
#               filter,  multiple  values are concatenated as comma
#               separated   strings.   The   expansion_limit    and
#               size_limit  parameters explained below allow one to
#               restrict the number of values in the result,  which
#               is  especially useful for maps that should return a
#               single value.
# 
#               The default value %s specifies that each  attribute
#               value should be used as is.
# 
#               NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the result filter!
# 
#        domain (default: no domain list)
#               This  is a list of domain names, paths to files, or
#               dictionaries. When specified, only fully  qualified
#               search  keys  with  a  *non-empty*  localpart and a
#               matching domain are  eligible  for  lookup:  'user'
#               lookups,  bare domain lookups and "@domain" lookups
#               are not performed. This  can  significantly  reduce
#               the query load on the LDAP server.
#                   domain = postfix.org, hash:/etc/postfix/search-
#               domains
# 
#               It is best not to use LDAP  to  store  the  domains
#               eligible for LDAP lookups.
# 
#               NOTE:  DO  NOT  define  this parameter for local(8)
#               aliases.
# 
#        result_attribute (default: maildrop)
#               The attribute(s) Postfix will read from any  direc-
#               tory entries returned by the lookup, to be resolved
#               to an email address.
#                   result_attribute = mailbox,maildrop
# 
#        special_result_attribute (No default)
#               The attribute(s) of directory entries that can con-
#               tain  DNs or URLs. If found, a recursive subsequent
#               search is done using their values.
#                   special_result_attribute = member
# 
#               DN recursion retrieves the  same  result_attributes
#               as the main query, including the special attributes
#               for further  recursion.  URI  processing  retrieves
#               only  those attributes that are included in the URI
#               definition    and    are    *also*    listed     in
#               "result_attribute".  If  the  URI  lists any of the
#               map's special result  attributes,  these  are  also
#               retrieved and used recursively.
# 
#        scope (default: sub)
#               The  LDAP  search  scope: sub, base, or one.  These
#               translate into LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, LDAP_SCOPE_BASE,
#               and LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL.
# 
#        bind (default: yes)
#               Whether  or  not  to bind to the LDAP server. Newer
#               LDAP implementations don't require clients to bind,
#               which saves time. Example:
#                   bind = no
# 
#               If  you do need to bind, you might consider config-
#               uring Postfix to connect to the local machine on  a
#               port  that's  an SSL tunnel to your LDAP server. If
#               your LDAP server doesn't natively support SSL,  put
#               a tunnel (wrapper, proxy, whatever you want to call
#               it) on that system too.  This  should  prevent  the
#               password  from traversing the network in the clear.
# 
#        bind_dn (default: empty)
#               If you do have to bind, do  it  with  this  distin-
#               guished name. Example:
#                   bind_dn = uid=postfix, dc=your, dc=com
# 
#        bind_pw (default: empty)
#               The  password  for the distinguished name above. If
#               you have to use this, you probably want to make the
#               map configuration file readable only by the Postfix
#               user. When using the obsolete ldap:ldapsource  syn-
#               tax, with map parameters in main.cf, it is not pos-
#               sible to securely store the bind password. This  is
#               because main.cf needs to be world readable to allow
#               local accounts to submit mail via the sendmail com-
#               mand. Example:
#                   bind_pw = postfixpw
# 
#        cache (IGNORED with a warning)
# 
#        cache_expiry (IGNORED with a warning)
# 
#        cache_size (IGNORED with a warning)
#               The  above  parameters  are  NO LONGER SUPPORTED by
#               Postfix.   Cache  support  has  been  dropped  from
#               OpenLDAP as of release 2.1.13.
# 
#        recursion_limit (default: 1000)
#               A  limit on the nesting depth of DN and URL special
#               result attribute evaluation. The limit  must  be  a
#               non-zero positive number.
# 
#        expansion_limit (default: 0)
#               A  limit  on  the  total  number of result elements
#               returned (as a comma separated list)  by  a  lookup
#               against  the  map.   A setting of zero disables the
#               limit. Lookups fail with a temporary error  if  the
#               limit  is exceeded.  Setting the limit to 1 ensures
#               that lookups do not return multiple values.
# 
#        size_limit (default: $expansion_limit)
#               A limit on the number of LDAP entries  returned  by
#               any  single  LDAP  query  performed  as part of the
#               lookup. A setting of 0 disables the limit.   Expan-
#               sion  of DN and URL references involves nested LDAP
#               queries, each of which is separately  subjected  to
#               this limit.
# 
#               Note:  even a single LDAP entry can generate multi-
#               ple lookup results, via multiple result  attributes
#               and/or  multi-valued  result attributes. This limit
#               caps the per query resource utilization on the LDAP
#               server,  not  the  final multiplicity of the lookup
#               result. It is  analogous  to  the  "-z"  option  of
#               "ldapsearch".
# 
#        dereference (default: 0)
#               When  to  dereference LDAP aliases. (Note that this
#               has nothing do with Postfix aliases.) The permitted
#               values  are  those  legal  for the OpenLDAP/UM LDAP
#               implementations:
# 
#               0      never
# 
#               1      when searching
# 
#               2      when locating the base object for the search
# 
#               3      always
# 
#               See ldap.h or the ldap_open(3) or ldapsearch(1) man
#               pages for more information. And if you're using  an
#               LDAP package that has other possible values, please
#               bring  it  to  the  attention   of   the   postfix-
#               users@postfix.org mailing list.
# 
#        chase_referrals (default: 0)
#               Sets  (or clears) LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS (requires LDAP
#               version 3 support).
# 
#        version (default: 2)
#               Specifies the LDAP protocol version to use.
# 
#        debuglevel (default: 0)
#               What level to set for  debugging  in  the  OpenLDAP
#               libraries.
# 
# LDAP SSL AND STARTTLS PARAMETERS
#        If  you're  using the OpenLDAP libraries compiled with SSL
#        support, Postfix can connect to LDAP SSL servers  and  can
#        issue the STARTTLS command.
# 
#        LDAP  SSL service can be requested by using a LDAP SSL URL
#        in the server_host parameter:
#            server_host = ldaps://ldap.your.com:636
# 
#        STARTTLS can be turned on with the start_tls parameter:
#            start_tls = yes
# 
#        Both forms require LDAP protocol version 3, which  has  to
#        be set explicitly with:
#            version = 3
# 
#        If any of the Postfix programs querying the map is config-
#        ured in master.cf to run chrooted,  all  the  certificates
#        and keys involved have to be copied to the chroot jail. Of
#        course, the private keys should only be  readable  by  the
#        user "postfix".
# 
#        The  following  parameters  are  relevant  to LDAP SSL and
#        STARTTLS:
# 
#        start_tls (default: no)
#               Whether or not to issue STARTTLS upon connection to
#               the  server.  Don't set this with LDAP SSL (the SSL
#               session is setup automatically when the TCP connec-
#               tion is opened).
# 
#        tls_ca_cert_dir   (No   default;   set   either   this  or
#        tls_ca_cert_file)
#               Directory  containing  X509  Certificate  Authority
#               certificates in PEM format which are to  be  recog-
#               nized  by  the  client  in SSL/TLS connections. The
#               files each contain one CA certificate.   The  files
#               are  looked  up  by the CA subject name hash value,
#               which must hence be available. If more than one  CA
#               certificate  with  the  same name hash value exist,
#               the extension must be different  (e.g.  9d66eef0.0,
#               9d66eef0.1  etc).  The  search  is performed in the
#               ordering of the  extension  number,  regardless  of
#               other  properties  of  the  certificates.  Use  the
#               c_rehash utility (from the OpenSSL distribution) to
#               create the necessary links.
# 
#        tls_ca_cert_file   (No   default;   set   either  this  or
#        tls_ca_cert_dir)
#               File containing the X509 Certificate Authority cer-
#               tificates in PEM format which are to be  recognized
#               by  the client in SSL/TLS connections. This setting
#               takes precedence over tls_ca_cert_dir.
# 
#        tls_cert (No default; you must set this)
#               File containing client's  X509  certificate  to  be
#               used by the client in SSL/ TLS connections.
# 
#        tls_key (No default; you must set this)
#               File  containing  the  private key corresponding to
#               the above tls_cert.
# 
#        tls_require_cert (default: no)
#               Whether or not to request server's X509 certificate
#               and  check  its  validity when establishing SSL/TLS
#               connections.
# 
#        tls_random_file (No default)
#               Path of a file to  obtain  random  bits  from  when
#               /dev/[u]random  is not available, to be used by the
#               client in SSL/TLS connections.
# 
#        tls_cipher_suite (No default)
#               Cipher suite to use in SSL/TLS negotiations.
# 
# EXAMPLE
#        Here's a basic example for using LDAP to look up  local(8)
#        aliases.  Assume that in main.cf, you have:
#            alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases,
#                ldap:/etc/ldap-aliases.cf
# 
#        and in ldap:/etc/ldap-aliases.cf you have:
#            server_host = ldap.my.com
#            search_base = dc=my, dc=com
# 
#        Upon  receiving  mail  for a local address "ldapuser" that
#        isn't found in the  /etc/aliases  database,  Postfix  will
#        search   the   LDAP   server  listening  at  port  389  on
#        ldap.my.com.  It will bind  anonymously,  search  for  any
#        directory  entries  whose mailacceptinggeneralid attribute
#        is "ldapuser", read the  "maildrop"  attributes  of  those
#        found,  and build a list of their maildrops, which will be
#        treated as RFC822 addresses to which the message  will  be
#        delivered.
