# 
# NAME
#        regexp_table - format of Postfix regular expression tables
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        regexp:/etc/postfix/filename
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The Postfix mail system uses optional tables  for  address
#        rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in dbm
#        or db format. Alternatively, lookup tables can  be  speci-
#        fied in POSIX regular expression form.
# 
#        To  find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix sys-
#        tem supports use the postconf -m command.
# 
#        The general form of a Postfix regular expression table is:
# 
#        pattern result
#               When  pattern matches a search string, use the cor-
#               responding result.
# 
#        multi-line text
#               A line that starts with whitespace (space  or  tab)
#               is  a  continuation  of the previous line. An empty
#               line terminates the previous line, as does  a  line
#               that  starts with non-whitespace (text or comment).
#               A comment line that starts with whitespace does not
#               terminate multi-line text.
# 
#        comments
#               The  # is recognized as the start of a comment, but
#               only when it is the first non-whitespace  character
#               on  a line.  A comment terminates at the end of the
#               line, even when the next line starts  with  whites-
#               pace.
# 
#        pattern1!pattern2 result
#               Matches pattern1 but not pattern2.
# 
#        Each pattern is a regular expression enclosed by a pair of
#        delimiters.  The regular expression syntax is described in
#        re_format(7).  The expression delimiter can be any charac-
#        ter, except whitespace or  characters  that  have  special
#        meaning  (traditionally  the  forward  slash is used). The
#        regular expression can contain whitespace.
# 
#        By default, matching is case-insensitive, although follow-
#        ing  the  second slash with an `i' flag will reverse this.
#        Other flags are `x' (disable extended expression  syntax),
#        and `m' (enable multi-line mode).
# 
#        Each  pattern  is applied to the entire lookup key string.
#        Depending on the application, that  string  is  an  entire
#        client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire
#        mail address.  Thus, no parent domain  or  parent  network
#        search  is  done,  and  user@domain mail addresses are not
#        broken up into their user and  domain  constituent  parts,
#        nor is user+foo broken up into user and foo.
# 
#        Patterns  are  applied  in  the  order as specified in the
#        table, until a pattern is found that  matches  the  search
#        string.
# 
#        Substitution  of  substrings  from  the matched expression
#        into the result string is possible using $1, $2, etc.. The
#        macros in the result string may need to be written as ${n}
#        or $(n) if they aren't followed by whitespace.
# 
# EXAMPLE SMTPD ACCESS MAP
#        # Disallow sender-specified routing. This is a must if you relay mail
#        # for other domains.
#        /[%!@].*[%!@]/       550 Sender-specified routing rejected
# 
#        # Postmaster is OK, that way they can talk to us about how to fix
#        # their problem.
#        /^postmaster@/       OK
# 
#        # Protect your outgoing majordomo exploders
#        /^(.*)-outgoing@(.*)$/!/^owner-/         550 Use ${1}@${2} instead
# 
# EXAMPLE HEADER FILTER MAP
#        # These were once common in junk mail.
#        /^Subject: make money fast/     REJECT
#        /^To: friend@public\.com/       REJECT
