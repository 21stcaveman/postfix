# NAME
#        etrn - format of Postfix etrn table
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        etrn_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/etrn
#        etrn_maps = dbm:/etc/postfix/etrn
# 
#        postmap /etc/postfix/etrn
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  optional  etrn file specifies what destination domain
#        names can be specified in SMTP ETRN commands. This  infor-
#        mation is used by the smtpd(8) and flushd(8) daemon.
# 
#        Normally,  the file serves as input to the postmap(1) com-
#        mand.  The result, an indexed file in dbm or db format, is
#        used  for  fast  searching by the mail system. Execute the
#        command postmap /etc/postfix/etrn in order to rebuild  the
#        indexed file after changing the etrn table.
# 
#        When  the  table  is provided via other means such as NIS,
#        LDAP, SQL, or as regular expressions, the same lookups are
#        done as for ordinary indexed files.
# 
# TABLE FORMAT
#        The format of the etrn table is as follows:
# 
#        blanks and comments
#               Blank  lines  are  ignored,  as are lines beginning
#               with `#'.
# 
#        domain restrictions
#               The left-hand side, domain, specifies a destination
#               domain name that can be specified in ETRN commands.
# 
#               The right-hand side specifies one  or  more  access
#               restrictions.   Restrictions  are  processed in the
#               given order and  the  search  stops  at  the  first
#               match.
# 
#               reject_unknown_client
#                      Reject the request if the client hostname is
#                      unknown.
# 
#               permit_mynetworks
#                      Permit the request  if  the  client  address
#                      matches $mynetworks.
# 
#               reject_maps_rbl
#                      Reject  the  request  if  the reverse client
#                      network    address    is    listed     under
#                      $maps_rbl_domains.
# 
#               reject Reject the request. Place this at the end of
# 
#                                                                 1
# 
# ETRN(5)                                                   ETRN(5)
# 
#                      a restriction list.
# 
#               permit Permit the request. Place this at the end of
#                      a restriction list.
# 
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
#        The  following  main.cf parameters are especially relevant
#        to this topic. See the Postfix  main.cf  file  for  syntax
#        details  and  for  default  values. Use the postfix reload
#        command after a configuration change.
# 
#        etrn_maps
#               Tables that specify what domains have ETRN service.
#               For  each table entry, the left-hand side specifies
#               a destination domain name that can be specified  in
#               an  ETRN request, and the right-hand side specifies
#               a list of access restrictions for SMTP clients that
#               issue ETRN for the domain.
# 
#        fast_flush_maps
#               The  table with names of destinations that this MTA
#               provides the fast flush service  for.  By  default,
#               this is set to $etrn_maps.
# 
#        relay_domains
#               The  list  of  domains  that this MTA is willing to
#               forward mail from or to. This defaults to $mydesti-
#               nation, $fast_flush_maps.
