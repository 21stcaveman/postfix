# MYSQL_TABLE(5)                                     MYSQL_TABLE(5)
# 
# NAME
#        mysql_table - Postfix MySQL client configuration
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        postmap -q "string" mysql:/etc/postfix/filename
# 
#        postmap -q - mysql:/etc/postfix/filename <inputfile
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  Postfix  mail system uses optional tables for address
#        rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in dbm
#        or db format.
# 
#        Alternatively,  lookup  tables  can  be specified as MySQL
#        databases.  In order to use MySQL lookups, define a  MySQL
#        source as a lookup table in main.cf, for example:
#            alias_maps = mysql:/etc/mysql-aliases.cf
# 
#        The file /etc/postfix/mysql-aliases.cf has the same format
#        as the Postfix main.cf file, and can specify  the  parame-
#        ters described below.
# 
# ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATION
#        For  compatibility with other Postfix lookup tables, MySQL
#        parameters can also be defined in main.cf.  In order to do
#        that,  specify  as  MySQL source a name that doesn't begin
#        with a slash or a dot.  The MySQL parameters will then  be
#        accessible as the name you've given the source in its def-
#        inition, an underscore, and the  name  of  the  parameter.
#        For example, if the map is specified as "mysql:mysqlname",
#        the parameter "hosts" below would be defined in main.cf as
#        "mysqlname_hosts".
# 
#        Note:  with this form, the passwords for the MySQL sources
#        are written in main.cf, which is normally  world-readable.
#        Support  for this form will be removed in a future Postfix
#        version.
# 
# LIST MEMBERSHIP
#        When using SQL to store lists such as $mynetworks, $mydes-
#        tination,  $relay_domains, $local_recipient_maps, etc., it
#        is important to understand that the table must store  each
#        list  member  as a separate key. The table lookup verifies
#        the *existence* of the  key.  See  "Postfix  lists  versus
#        tables"  in the DATABASE_README document for a discussion.
# 
#        Do NOT create tables that return the full list of  domains
#        in  $mydestination or $relay_domains etc., or IP addresses
#        in $mynetworks.
# 
#        DO create tables with each matching item as a key and with
#        an  arbitrary value. With SQL databases it is not uncommon
#        to return the key itself or a constant value.
# 
# MYSQL PARAMETERS
#        hosts  The hosts that Postfix will try to connect  to  and
#               query from.  Specify unix: for UNIX domain sockets,
#               inet: for TCP connections (default).  Example:
#                   hosts = host1.some.domain host2.some.domain
#                   hosts = unix:/file/name
# 
#               The hosts are tried in random order, with all  con-
#               nections  over  UNIX  domain  sockets  being  tried
#               before those over TCP.  The connections  are  auto-
#               matically  closed  after  being  idle  for  about 1
#               minute, and are  re-opened  as  necessary.  Postfix
#               versions  2.0 and earlier do not randomize the host
#               order.
# 
#               NOTE: if you specify localhost as a hostname  (even
#               if you prefix it with inet:), MySQL will connect to
#               the  default  UNIX  domain  socket.   In  order  to
#               instruct MySQL to connect to localhost over TCP you
#               have to specify
#                   hosts = 127.0.0.1
# 
#        user, password
#               The user name and password to log  into  the  mysql
#               server.  Example:
#                   user = someone
#                   password = some_password
# 
#        dbname The database name on the servers. Example:
#                   dbname = customer_database
# 
#        The  following  parameters  are  used  to fill in a SELECT
#        query template of the form:
#            select [select_field] from [table] where
#                [where_field] = '$lookup' [additional_conditions]
# 
#        $lookup contains the search string, and is escaped  so  if
#        it contains single quotes or other odd characters, it will
#        not cause a parse error, or worse, a security problem.
# 
#        select_field
#               The SQL "select" parameter. Example:
#                   select_field = forw_addr
# 
#        table  The SQL "select .. from" table name. Example:
#                   table = mxaliases
# 
#        where_field
#               The SQL "select .. where" parameter. Example:
#                   where_field = alias
# 
#        additional_conditions
#               Additional conditions to the SQL query. Example:
#                   additional_conditions = and status = 'paid'
