# TCP_TABLE(5)                                         TCP_TABLE(5)
# 
# NAME
#        tcp_table - Postfix client/server table lookup protocol
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        postmap -q "string" tcp:host:port
# 
#        postmap -q - regexp:host:port <inputfile
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  Postfix  mail system uses optional tables for address
#        rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in dbm
#        or  db  format. Alternatively, lookup tables can be speci-
#        fied as a TCP client/server pair.
# 
#        To find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix  sys-
#        tem supports use the postconf -m command.
# 
#        To   test  lookup  tables,  use  the  postmap  command  as
#        described in the SYNOPSIS above.
# 
# PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION
#        The TCP map class implements a very simple  protocol:  the
#        client  sends  a  request, and the server sends one reply.
#        Requests and replies are sent as one line of  ASCII  text,
#        terminated  by  the  ASCII  newline character. Request and
#        reply parameters (see below) are separated by  whitespace.
# 
# ENCODING
#        In  request  and reply parameters, the character % and any
#        non-printing and whitespace characters must be replaced by
#        %XX,  XX being the corresponding ASCII hexadecimal charac-
#        ter value. The hexadecimal codes can be specified  in  any
#        case (upper, lower, mixed).
# 
# REQUEST FORMAT
#        Requests are strings that serve as lookup key in the simu-
#        lated table.
# 
#        get SPACE key NEWLINE
#               Look up data under the specified key.
# 
#        put SPACE key SPACE value NEWLINE
#               This request is currently not implemented.
# 
# REPLY FORMAT
#        Replies must be no longer than 4096  characters  including
#        the newline terminator, and must have the following form:
# 
#        500 SPACE optional-text NEWLINE
#               In  case  of  a  lookup request, the requested data
#               does not exist.  In case of an update request,  the
#               request was rejected.
# 
#        400 SPACE optional-text NEWLINE
#               This  indicates  an error condition. The text gives
#               the nature of the problem. The client should  retry
#               the request later.
# 
#        200 SPACE text NEWLINE
#               The request was successful. In the case of a lookup
#               request, the text contains an  encoded  version  of
#               the   requested   data.    Otherwise  the  text  is
#               optional.
