This is the Postfix 3.3 (stable) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-3.3.x where 3=major
release number, 3=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-3.4-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 3.1 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-3.2
before proceeding.

License change
---------------

This software is distributed with a dual license: in addition to the
historical IBM Public License 1.0, it is now also distributed with the
more recent Eclipse Public License 2.0. Recipients can choose to take
the software under the license of their choice. Those who are more
comfortable with the IPL can continue with that license.

Major changes - compatibility safety net
----------------------------------------

[20180106] With compatibility_level < 1, the Postfix SMTP server
now warns for mail that would be blocked by the Postfix 2.10
smtpd_relay_restrictions feature. This extends the safety net for
sites that upgrade from earlier Postfix versions (questions on the
postfix-users list show a steady trickle). See COMPATIBILITY_README
for details.

Major changes - configuration
-----------------------------

[20170617] The postconf command warns about unknown parameter names
in a Postfix database configuration file, specified as an absolute
pathname.

[20180113] New read-only service_name parameter that contains the
master.cf service name. This parameter is set only in daemon
processes. This allows, for example, setting the syslog_name in
master.cf with "-o syslog_name=postfix/$service_name" for the
"submission", "smtps", and "relay" services.

Major changes - container support
---------------------------------

[20171218] Preliminary support to run Postfix in the foreground,
with "postfix start-fg". This requires that multi-instance support
is disabled.

Major changes - database support
---------------------------------

[20170617] The postconf command warns about unknown parameter names
in a Postfix database configuration file.

[20171227] The pgsql_table(5) hosts parameter now supports the
postgresql:// URI syntax. Contributed by Magosányi Árpád.

Major changes - header format
-----------------------------

[20180010] This release changes the format of 'full name' information
in Postfix-generated From: headers, when a local program such as
/bin/mail submits a message without From: header.

Postfix-generated From: headers with 'full name' information are
now formatted as "From: name <address>" by default. Specify
"header_from_format = obsolete" to get the earlier form "From:
address (name)". See the postconf(5) manpage for more details.

Major changes - invisible changes
---------------------------------

[20170617] Additional paranoia in the VSTRING implementation: a
null byte after the end of vstring buffers so that C-style string
operations won't scribble past the end; earlier detection of bad
length and precision format string specifiers (this just improves
error handling, as format strings cannot be specified externally).

Major changes - milter support
------------------------------

[20170221] The Postfix Milter client no longer encloses single-letter
macro names inside {}, even though this form is supported since
Sendmail version 8.7.

[20171223] Milter applications can now send RET and ENVID parameters
in SMFIR_CHGFROM (change envelope sender) requests.

Major changes - mixed IPv6/IPv4 support
---------------------------------------

[20170505] Workaround for mail delivery problems with destinations
that announce primarily IPv6 MX addresses but that are unreachable
over IPv6, when the smtp_address_limit eliminates most or all IPv4
addresses. This includes the case that Postfix IPv6 support is
turned on, but the local machine has no IPv6 connectivity.

The Postfix SMTP client will now attempt to schedule similar numbers
of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Specify "smtp_balance_mx_inet_protocols
= no" to disable this workaround.

Major changes - xclient
-----------------------

[20171218] The Postfix SMTP server now allows the XCLIENT command
before STARTTLS when TLS is required. This is useful for servers
that run behind a reverse proxy server such as nginx.
