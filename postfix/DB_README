Purpose of this document
========================

This document describes how to build Postfix with Berkeley DB
support on systems that ship without DB library. The canonical
third-party source for Berkeley DB is www.sleepycat.com.

The information can also be used to build Postfix with a non-default
Berkeley DB version. However, the file formats of Berkeley DB
version 2 and later are not compatible with the older Berkeley DB
version that ships with, for example, 4.4BSD.

Building Postfix with third-party Berkeley DB support
=====================================================

If you installed the Berkeley DB from Sleepycat, use something like:

    % make tidy
    % make makefiles CCARGS="-DHAS_DB -I/usr/local/BerkeleyDB/include" \
	AUXLIBS=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB/lib/libdb.a
    % make
