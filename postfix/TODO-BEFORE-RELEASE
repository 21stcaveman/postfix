Documentation needed before official release:
=============================================

- RELEASE_NOTES file with all changes since Postfix version 2.0.

- Document post-install command (perhaps absorb the user interface
into the postfix command).

- Install qshape command and manual page?

- HTML Overview of all Postfix manual pages; perhaps a clickable
map like the one in ADDRESS_REWRITING_README.

- ASCII overview of all Postfix manual pages, derived from HTML
version.

- ASCII Overview of all README files, derived from HTML version.

- CYRUS_README, based on LMTP_README and Luca Berra's writeup.

- Remove CYRUS specific material from LMTP_README

- QMAIL/EZMLM compatibility document.

Things to clean up before official release:
===========================================

- Clean up the mantools scripts; eliminate unneccesary intermediate
html step when creating the postconf(5) UNIX manual page.

- Clean up the proto/man/html Makefiles and mantools scripts.

Functionality to be removed before official release:
====================================================

- The anvil daemon. Its user interface needs to evolve.

- The tcp_table dictionary type. It's a weak protocol, and the
SMTPD policy delegation protocol provides a superior mechanism.

- Change top-level Makefiles, disable -DSNAPSHOT.
