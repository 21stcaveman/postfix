Address verification
====================

Sender address verification blocks mail from an unknown sender
address until after the address is verified.  An address is verified
by probing the nearest MTA for that address, without actually
delivering mail to it (SMTP interruptus). Probe messages are like
normail mail, but are discarded instead of being deferred or bounced.

The same technique may be useful to block mail for undeliverable
recipients, for example on mail relay hosts that do not have a copy
of all the relayed recipient addresses.

With address verification turned on, normal mail will suffer only
a short delay of up to 9 seconds while an address is verified for
the first time.  Once an address status is known, the status is
cached and Postfix replies immediately.  When verification takes
longer than 9 seconds the Postfix SMTP server defers the sender or
recipient address message with a 450 reply. Normal mail clients
will connect again after some delay.

Sender and recipient address verification are turned on with the
"reject_unverified_sender" and "reject_unverified_recipient"
restrictions, respectively.

Recipient address verification is relatively straightforward and
there are no surprises. If a recipient probe fails, then Postfix
rejects mail for the recipient address.  If a recipient probe
succeeds, then Postfix accepts mail for the recipient address.

Turning on sender address verification
======================================

Unfortunately, sender address verification cannot simply be turned
on - you are likely to lose legitimate mail from mis-configured
systems. You will almost certainly have to set up white lists for
specific addresses or even for entire domains.

To find out how sender address verification would affect your mail,
specify "warn_if_reject reject_unverified_sender" so that you can
see what mail would be blocked:

    smtpd_sender_restrictions = 
	... 
	check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/sender_access
	reject_unknown_sender_domain
	warn_if_reject reject_unverified_sender 
	...

This is also a good way to populate your cache with address
verification results before you start to actually reject mail.

The sender_access restriction is needed to whitelist domains that
are known to be OK. See the section titled "Limitations" at the
end of this document.

The "reject_unknown_sender_domain" restriction blocks mail from
non-existent domains. Putting this before "reject_unverified_sender"
avoids the overhead of generating unnecessary probe messages.

The unverified_sender_reject_code parameter (default 450) specifies
how Postfix replies when a sender address is known to bounce.
Change this setting into 550 when you trust Postfix's judgments.

Caching
=======

NOTE: By default, address verification information is not stored
in a persistent file. You have to specify one in main.cf (see
below). Persistent storage is off by default because it may need
more disk space than is available in your root file system.

Address verification information is cached by the Postfix verify
daemon.  Postfix has a bunch of parameters that control the caching
of positive and negative results. Refer to the verify(8) manual
page or the sample-verify.cf file for details.

The address_verify_map (NOTE: singular) configuration parameter
specifies an optional persistent database for sender address
verification results.  If you don't specify a file, all address
verification information is lost after "postfix reload" or "postfix
stop".

If your root file system has sufficient space, try:

    address_verify_map = btree:/etc/postfix/verify

NOTE: Do not put this file in a file system that fills up. When
the address verification table gets corrupted the world comes to
an end and YOU will have to MANUALLY fix things as described in
the next section. Meanwhile you will not receive mail via SMTP.

The verify daemon process will create a new database when none
exists, and will open/create the file before it enters the chroot
jail or before it drops root privileges.

Managing the address verification database
==========================================

Right now, no tools are provided to manage the address verification
database. If the file gets too big, or if it gets corrupted, you
can manually delete the file and run "postfix reload".  The new
verify daemon process will then create a new, empty, database.

Limitations
===========

Postfix probes the nearest MTA for the sender domain without actually
sending mail. If that MTA accepts the recipient, then Postfix
assumes that the address is deliverable, even when the address will
bounce AFTER that MTA accepts it.

You will probably want to put a whitelist before the address
verification restriction, so that you can exclude known to be OK
domains or addresses from verification. Although Postfix will not
mark a known-to-be-good address as bad after a probe fails, it is
better to be safe than sorry.

    smtpd_sender_restrictions =
	...
	check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/sender_access
	reject_unknown_sender_domain
	reject_unverified_sender
	...

NOTE: You will have to whitelist sites such as securityfocus.com
and other sites that operate mailing lists that use a different
sender address for each posting (VERP).  Such addresses pollute
the address verification cache quickly, and generate unnecessary
sender verification probes.
