Purpose of the XCLIENT extension to SMTP
========================================

The XCLIENT command targets problems in the following areas:

1 - Access control tests. SMTP server access rules can be difficult
to verify when decisions can be triggered by remote clients only.
In order to facilitate access rule testing, an SMTP client test
program needs the ability to override the SMTP server's idea of
the SMTP client hostname, network address, and other information,
for the entire duration of an SMTP session.

2 - Logging after content filter. With Internet->MTA1->filter->MTA2
style content filter applications, remote client information is
lost when MTA1 gives the mail to the content filter.  To simplify
the interpretation of MTA2 logging, it would help if MTA1 could
forward client information through the content filter to MTA2, for
a single message delivery.

3 - Post-filter access control and logging. With Internet->filter->MTA
style content filter applications, the filter can be simplified if
it can delegate decisions concerning mail relay and other access
control to the MTA. As in the first example, this requires that
the filter can override the MTA's idea of the SMTP client hostname,
network address, and other information, for the entire duration of
an SMTP session.

Command overview
================

XCLIENT is an extension to SMTP.  The EHLO keyword associated with
this extension is XCLIENT.

The XCLIENT OVERRIDE command updates the remote client attributes
that the MTA normally uses for access control, message headers,
logging and so on, for the duration of an entire SMTP session.

The XCLIENT FORWARD command maintains an additional set of attributes
that concern only one message delivery attempt.  In the absence of
forwarded attributes the MTA must use the normal remote client
attribute values.

The general command syntax is described below.  Upper case and
quoted strings specify terminals, lowercase strings specify meta
terminals, SP is whitespace, and descriptive text is enclosed in
{}.  Although command and attribute names are shown below in upper
case, they are in fact case insensitive.

    xclient-command = XCLIENT SP function SP 1*( attribute )

    function = ( OVERRIDE | FORWARD )

    attribute = name"="value

    name = ( CLIENT_NAME|CLIENT_ADDR|CLIENT_CODE|CLIENT_PROTO|CLIENT_HELO )

    value = ( { empty } | xtext )

    xtext = { attribute value encoded as per RFC 1891 }

The XCLIENT command can be sent at any time except in the middle
of a mail delivery transaction (i.e.  between MAIL and DOT).  The
command may be pipelined after the server EHLO reply announces
ESMTP pipelining support.

The server reply codes are as follows:

   Code | Meaning
   -----|------------
    250 | success 
    501 | command syntax error
    502 | unrecognized request name
    421 | unable to proceed

The server must report success in case of an unrecognized attribute
name, although it may log a warning.

Specific usage scenarios
========================

This section discusses the semantics of XCLIENT requests.  Specific
syntax details are given in the next section.

The XCLIENT OVERRIDE request modifies remote client attributes that
the MTA normally uses for access control, message headers, logging,
and for other purposes, for the duraction of the entire SMTP session.
Attributes that are not specified in XCLIENT OVERRIDE requests are
not modified.

The following example overrides only the client hostname and network
address, leaving unchanged all other client attributes such as the
mail protocol or the hostname given in the HELO command:

    XCLIENT OVERRIDE CLIENT_NAME=spike.porcupine.org
    XCLIENT OVERRIDE CLIENT_ADDR=168.100.189.2

The XCLIENT FORWARD request specifies remote client attributes
concerning only one message delivery attempt. The attributes are
discarded after the next MAIL FROM transaction finishes. In the
absence of any XCLIENT FORWARD attributes, the MTA must use the
normal client attributes.

If only a subset of all possible XCLIENT FORWARD attributes is
specified, the unspecified attributes must be treated as if they
are unknown. The implementation must not replace missing XCLIENT
FORWARD attributes by normal attributes.

The following example updates all forwarded client attributes that
are defined in this document, leaving none at their default unknown
value:

    XCLIENT FORWARD CLIENT_NAME=spike.porcupine.org CLIENT_ADDR=168.100.189.2
    XCLIENT FORWARD CLIENT_HELO=spike.porcupine.org CLIENT_PROTO=ESMTP

Note 1: attributes specified with successive XCLIENT commands
accumulate.

Note 2: XCLIENT FORWARD attributes take precedence over XCLIENT
OVERRIDE attributes.

Attribute value details
=======================

Attribute values are encoded as RFC 1891 xtext strings. To explicitly
specify that an attribute value is unavailable, the value must be
empty; the client must not send its own internal representation of
unavailable information.

The CLIENT_CODE attribute specifies CLIENT_NAME hostname lookup
status information.  Values are OK (success), TEMP (temporary lookup
failure) or PERM (permanent lookup failure). When CLIENT_CODE is
set to any value other than OK, the CLIENT_NAME attribute is
automatically set to the unknown value.

The CLIENT_NAME attribute should specify a syntactically valid
domain name and not a numerical address.  When a null client name
is specified (i.e.  the client name is unknown), the CLIENT_CODE
attribute is implicitly set to PERM. When a valid domain name is
specified, CLIENT_CODE is implicitly set to OK. The server may
process a syntactically invalid domain name as if it were unknown.

The CLIENT_ADDR attribute must specify a numerical network address
without [].

The CLIENT_PROTO attribute should be a string of up to 64 printable
characters, where printable is defined by the ANSI C isascii() and
isprint() predicates.

The CLIENT_HELO attribute should be a syntactically valid HELO
parameter value.

Note 3: syntactically valid CLIENT_NAME and CLIENT_HELO attributes
can be up to 255 characters long. The client must not send XCLIENT
commands that exceed the 512 character limit of SMTP commands.

Note 4: attribute values may end up in Received: or other message
headers.  The receiving MTA may substitute characters in order to
not violate RFC 822 or RFC 2822.

Security
========

The XCLIENT command changes audit trails and/or client access
permissions. For these reasons, use of these commands must be
restricted to authorized clients only.

The examples in this document assume that XCLIENT does not override
its own access control mechanism.

SMTP connection caching
=======================

SMTP connection caching makes it possible to deliver multiple
messages within the same SMTP session. Thus, one persistent SMTP
session with a content filter can carry messages from unrelated
clients.  The XCLIENT FORWARD attributes are reset after the MAIL
FROM command completes, so there is no risk of information leakage.
