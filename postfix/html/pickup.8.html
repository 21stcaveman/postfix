PICKUP(8)                                               PICKUP(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       pickup - Postfix local mail pickup

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>pickup</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>pickup</b>  daemon waits for hints that new mail has been
       dropped into the <b>maildrop</b> directory, and feeds it into the
       <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a>  daemon.  Ill-formatted files are deleted with-
       out notifying the originator.  This program expects to  be
       run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>mas</a><a href="master.8.html">ter</b>(8)</a> process manager.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       None. The <b>pickup</b> daemon does not interact with the outside
       world.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The <b>pickup</b> daemon is  moderately  security  sensitive.  It
       runs  with  fixed  low privilege and can run in a chrooted
       environment.  However, the program reads files from poten-
       tially  hostile  users.   The <b>pickup</b> daemon opens no files
       for writing, is careful about  what  files  it  opens  for
       reading, and does not actually touch any data that is sent
       to its public service endpoint.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       The <b>pickup</b> daemon copies mail from file to the  <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a>
       daemon.   It could avoid message copying overhead by send-
       ing a file descriptor instead of file data, but  then  the
       already  complex <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> daemon would have to deal with
       unfiltered user data.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       As the pickup daemon is a relatively long-running process,
       up  to  an  hour  may  pass  before a <b>main.cf</b> change takes
       effect.  Use the command "<b>postfix reload</b>" command to speed
       up a change.
