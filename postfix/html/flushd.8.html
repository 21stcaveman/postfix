FLUSHD(8)                                               FLUSHD(8)


<b>NAME</b>
       flushd - Postfix fast flush daemon

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>flushd</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The flush server maintains so-called "fast flush" logfiles
       with information about what messages are queued for a spe-
       cific  site.  This program expects to be run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>mas-</b>
       <b>ter</b>(8)</a> process manager.

       This server implements the following requests:

       FLUSH_REQ_ADD sitename queue_id
              Append a record to the per-site fast flush  logfile
              for the specified queue ID.

       FLUSH_REQ_SEND sitename
              Arrange  for  the delivery of all messages that are
              listed in the fast flush logfile for the  specified
              site.   After the logfile is processed, the file is
              truncated to length zero.

       The response to the client is one of:

       FLUSH_STAT_OK
              The request completed normally.

       FLUSH_STAT_BAD
              The flush server rejected the request (bad  request
              name, bad request parameter value).

       FLUSH_STAT_UNKNOWN
              The specified site has no fast flush logfile and is
              not configured to have one.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The fast flush server is moderately security-sensitive. It
       does  not  talk  to the network, but it does talk to local
       unprivileged users, in order to emulate "sendmail -qRsite"
       behavior.   For  this  reason all strings in a request are
       truncated at ine_length_limit.

       The fast flush server can run chrooted at fixed low privi-
       lege.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       In  reality,  this  server schedules delivery of messages,
       regardless of their destination. This limitation is due to
       the  fact  that  one  queue  runner has to handle mail for



                                                                1

       multiple destinations.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The following <b>main.cf</b> parameters are  especially  relevant
       to  this  program. See the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file for syntax
       details and for default values.  Use  the  <b>postfix</b>  <b>reload</b>
       command after a configuration change.

       <b>fast</b><i>_</i><b>flush</b><i>_</i><b>maps</b>
              The  table with names of destinations that this MTA
              provides the  fast  flush  service  for,  and  with
              clients  that  may issue the ETRN command for those
              destinations. Postfix maintains fast flush logfiles
              only for destinations listed in this table.

       <b>line</b><i>_</i><b>length</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>
              Maximal  length  of  strings in a fast flush client
              request.
