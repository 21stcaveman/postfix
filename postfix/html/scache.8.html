SCACHE(8)                                               SCACHE(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       scache - Postfix session cache server

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>scache</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  scache  server  maintains  the Postfix session cache.
       This information can be used by, for example, the  Postfix
       SMTP client.

       The  session  cache  is organized into logical destination
       names, physical endpoint names, and sessions.

       As a specific example, logical SMTP  destinations  specify
       (transport,  domain,  port),  and  physical SMTP endpoints
       specify (transport, IP address, port).   An  SMTP  session
       may be saved after a successful mail transaction.

       In  the general case, one logical destination may refer to
       zero or more physical endpoints, one physical endpoint may
       be  referenced  by  zero or more logical destinations, and
       one endpoint may refer to zero or more sessions.

       The exact syntax of a logical destination or endpoint name
       is  application  dependent;  the  <b>scache</b>  service does not
       care.  A session is stored as a file  descriptor  together
       with  application-dependent  information that is needed to
       re-activate a session object. Again, the <b>scache</b> service is
       completely  unaware about the details of that information.

       All information is stored  with  a  finite  time  to  live
       (ttl).  The session cache daemon terminates when no client
       is connected for <b><a href="postconf.5.html#max_idle">max_idle</a></b> time units.

       This server implements the following requests:

       <b>save_endp</b> <i>ttl endpoint endpoint</i><b>_</b><i>properties file</i><b>_</b><i>descriptor</i>
              Save the  specified  file  descriptor  and  session
              property  data  under  the specified endpoint name.
              The endpoint properties are used by the  client  to
              re-activate  a passivated session object.  queue ID
              is queued for the specified destination.

       <b>find_endp</b> <i>endpoint</i>
              Look  up  cached  properties  and  a  cached   file
              descriptor for the specified endpoint.

       <b>save_dest</b> <i>ttl destination destination</i><b>_</b><i>properties endpoint</i>
              Save  the binding between a logical destination and
              an endpoint under the  destination  name,  together
              with  destination  specific session properties. The
              destination properties are used by  the  client  to
              re-activate a passivated session object.

       <b>find_dest</b> <i>destination</i>
              Look  up cached destination properties, cached end-
              point properties, and a cached file descriptor  for
              the specified logical destination.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The  session  cache  server  is not security-sensitive. It
       does not talk to the network, and  it  does  not  talk  to
       local  users.  The scache server can run chrooted at fixed
       low privilege.

       The session cache server is not a trusted process. It must
       not  be  used to store information that is security sensi-
       tive.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       Sessions cannot be cached across multiple machines.

       When a session expires from the cache it is closed without
       protocol specific handshake.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       Changes   to   <b>main.cf</b>  are  picked  up  automatically  as
       <a href="scache.8.html">scache(8)</a> processes run for only a limited amount of time.
       Use the command "<b>postfix reload</b>" to speed up a change.

       The  text  below  provides  only  a parameter summary. See
       <a href="postconf.5.html">postconf(5)</a> for more details including examples.
