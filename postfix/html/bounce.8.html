BOUNCE(8)                                               BOUNCE(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       bounce - Postfix message bounce or defer daemon

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>bounce</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>bounce</b>  daemon  maintains  per-message log files with
       non-delivery status information. Each log  file  is  named
       after  the  queue file that it corresponds to, and is kept
       in a queue subdirectory named after the  service  name  in
       the  <b>master.cf</b> file (either <b>bounce</b>, <b>defer</b> or <b>trace</b>).  This
       program expects to be run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a> process  man-
       ager.

       The <b>bounce</b> daemon processes two types of service requests:

       <b>o</b>      Append a recipient status record to  a  per-message
              log file.

       <b>o</b>      Post  a  bounce  message, with a copy of a log file
              and of the corresponding message. When  the  bounce
              is posted successfully, the log file is deleted.

       The  software does a best effort to notify the sender that
       there was a problem. A notification is sent even when  the
       log file or original message cannot be read.

       Optionally,  a client can request that the per-message log
       file be deleted when the requested operation fails.   This
       is used by clients that cannot retry transactions by them-
       selves, and that  depend  on  retry  logic  in  their  own
       client.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC 822</a> (ARPA Internet Text Messages)
       <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1894.html">RFC 1894</a> (Delivery Status Notifications)
       <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2045.html">RFC 2045</a> (Format of Internet Message Bodies)

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       The  log  files  use  an ad-hoc, unstructured format. This
       will have to change in order to  easily  support  standard
       delivery status notifications.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       The  following  <b>main.cf</b> parameters are especially relevant
       to this program. See the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file  for  syntax
       details  and  for  default  values. Use the <b>postfix reload</b>
       command after a configuration change.

       <b>bounce_notice_recipient</b>
              The recipient of single bounce postmaster  notices.

       <b>2bounce_notice_recipient</b>
              The  recipient of double bounce postmaster notices.

       <b>delay_notice_recipient</b>
              The recipient of "delayed mail" postmaster notices.

       <b>bounce_size_limit</b>
              Limit  the  amount of original message context that
              is sent in a non-delivery notification.

       <b>backwards_bounce_logfile_compatibility</b>
              Controls whether the logfile will  be  readable  by
              old  Postfix  versions that used the ad-hoc logfile
              format of <i>&</i>lt;<i>address&</i>gt;<i>: text</i>.

       <b>mail_name</b>
              Use this mail system name in the introductory  text
              at the start of a bounce message.

       <b>notify_classes</b>
              Notify  the  postmaster  of  bounced mail when this
              parameter includes the <b>bounce</b>  class.  For  privacy
              reasons, the message body is not included.
