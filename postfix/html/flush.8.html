FLUSH(8)                                                 FLUSH(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       flush - Postfix fast flush server

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>flush</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  flush  server  maintains a record of deferred mail by
       destination.  This information is used to improve the per-
       formance of the SMTP <b>ETRN</b> request, and of its command-line
       equivalent, <b>sendmail -qR</b>.  This program expects to be  run
       from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>mas</a><a href="master.8.html">ter</b>(8)</a> process manager.

       The  record  is  implemented  as a per-destination logfile
       with as contents the queue IDs of deferred mail. A logfile
       is   append-only,   and  is  truncated  when  delivery  is
       requested for the corresponding destination. A destination
       is  the part on the right-hand side of the right-most <b>@</b> in
       an email address.

       Per-destination logfiles of deferred mail  are  maintained
       only  for eligible destinations. The list of eligible des-
       tinations is specified with the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#fast_flush_domains">fast_flush_domains</a></b> config-
       uration parameter, which defaults to <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a></b>.

       This server implements the following requests:

       <b>FLUSH_REQ_ADD</b> <i>sitename queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>
              Inform  the  fast  flush  server that the specified
              message is queued for <i>sitename</i>. Depending  on  log-
              ging  policy,  the  fast  flush  server  stores  or
              ignores the information.

       <b>FLUSH_REQ_SEND</b> <i>sitename</i>
              Request delivery of mail that is queued  for  <i>site-</i>
              <i>name</i>.   If  the  destination is eligible for a fast
              flush logfile, this request  triggers  delivery  of
              messages  listed in that destination's logfile, and
              the logfile is truncated to zero length; if mail is
              undeliverable it will be added back to the logfile.

              If the destination is not eligible for a fast flush
              logfile,  this  request  is rejected (see below for
              status codes).

       <b>TRIGGER_REQ_WAKEUP</b>
              This wakeup request from the master is an  alterna-
              tive way to request <b>FLUSH_REQ_REFRESH</b>.

       <b>FLUSH_REQ_REFRESH</b> (completes in the background)
              Refresh  non-empty  per-destination  logfiles  that
              were not read in <b><a href="postconf.5.html#fast_flush_refresh_time">fast_flush_refresh_time</a></b> hours,  by
              simulating send requests (see above) for the corre-
              sponding destinations.

              Delete empty per-destination logfiles that were not
              updated in <b><a href="postconf.5.html#fast_flush_purge_time">fast_flush_purge_time</a></b> days.

       <b>FLUSH_REQ_PURGE</b> (completes in the background)
              Refresh  all non-empty per-destination logfiles, by
              simulating send requests (see above) for the corre-
              sponding  destinations.   This  can  be  incredibly
              expensive when logging is enabled for many destina-
              tions, and is not recommended.

              Delete empty per-destination logfiles that were not
              updated in <b><a href="postconf.5.html#fast_flush_purge_time">fast_flush_purge_time</a></b> days.

       The server response is one of:

       <b>FLUSH_STAT_OK</b>
              The request completed normally.

       <b>FLUSH_STAT_BAD</b>
              The flush server rejected the request (bad  request
              name, bad request parameter value).

       <b>FLUSH_STAT_FAIL</b>
              The request failed.

       <b>FLUSH_STAT_DENY</b>
              The  request  was  denied  because  the destination
              domain is not eligible for fast flush  service,  or
              because the fast flush service is disabled.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The  fast  flush server is not security-sensitive. It does
       not talk to the network, and it does  not  talk  to  local
       users.   The  fast  flush server can run chrooted at fixed
       low privilege.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       Fast  flush  logfiles   are   truncated   only   after   a
       <b>FLUSH_REQ_SEND</b>  request,  not when mail is actually deliv-
       ered, and therefore can accumulate outdated  or  redundant
       data.  In order to maintain sanity, <b>FLUSH_REQ_REFRESH</b> must
       be executed periodically. This can  be  automated  with  a
       suitable  wakeup timer setting in the <b>master.cf</b> configura-
       tion file.

       Upon receipt of a request to deliver all mail for an  eli-
       gible  destination,  the <b>flush</b> server requests delivery of
       all messages that are listed in  that  destination's  log-
       file, regardless of the recipients of those messages. This
       is not an issue for mail that is sent to  a  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a></b>
       destination  because  such mail typically only has recipi-
       ents in one domain.
