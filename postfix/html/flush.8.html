FLUSH(8)                                                 FLUSH(8)


<b>NAME</b>
       flush - Postfix fast flush cache manager

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>flush</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  flush  server  maintains a record of deferred mail by
       destination.  This information is used to improve the per-
       formance of the SMTP <b>ETRN</b> request, and of its command-line
       equivalent, <b>sendmail</b> <b>-qR</b>.  This program expects to be  run
       from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a> process manager.

       The  record  is  implemented  as a per-destination logfile
       with as contents the queue IDs of deferred mail. A logfile
       is   append-only,   and  is  truncated  when  delivery  is
       requested for the corresponding destination. A destination
       is  the part on the right-hand side of the right-most <b>@</b> in
       an email address.

       Per-destination logfiles of deferred mail  are  maintained
       only  for  eligible  destinations. The policy is specified
       with the <b>fast</b><i>_</i><b>flush</b><i>_</i><b>cache</b><i>_</i><b>policy</b> configuration parameter:

       <b>all</b>    Maintain per-destination logfiles for all  destina-
              tions.

       <b>relay</b> (default policy)
              Maintain per-destination logfiles only for destina-
              tions that this system is willing to relay mail  to
              (as  controlled  by the <b>relay</b><i>_</i><b>domains</b> configuration
              parameter).

       <b>none</b>   Do not maintain per-destination logfiles.

       This server implements the following requests:

       <b>FLUSH</b><i>_</i><b>REQ</b><i>_</i><b>ADD</b> <i>sitename</i> <i>queue_id</i>
              Inform the cache manager that the specified message
              is  queued  for <i>sitename</i>. Depending on caching pol-
              icy, the cache manager stores or ignores the infor-
              mation.

       <b>FLUSH</b><i>_</i><b>REQ</b><i>_</i><b>SEND</b> <i>sitename</i>
              Request  delivery  of mail that is queued for <i>site-</i>
              <i>name</i>.  If the destination is eligible  for  a  fast
              flush  logfile,  this  request triggers delivery of
              specific messages;  the per-destination logfile  is
              truncated to zero length; if mail is undeliverable,
              it will be logged to the per-destination logfile.

              If the destination is not eligible for a fast flush
              logfile,  this  request  triggers  delivery  of all
              queued mail.



                                                                1





FLUSH(8)                                                 FLUSH(8)


       <b>TRIGGER</b><i>_</i><b>REQ</b><i>_</i><b>WAKEUP</b>
              This wakeup request from the master is an  alterna-
              tive way to request <b>FLUSH</b><i>_</i><b>REQ</b><i>_</i><b>REFRESH</b>.

       <b>FLUSH</b><i>_</i><b>REQ</b><i>_</i><b>REFRESH</b> (completes in the background)
              Refresh  non-empty  per-destination  logfiles  that
              were not read in  $<b>fast</b><i>_</i><b>flush</b><i>_</i><b>refresh</b><i>_</i><b>delay</b>  hours,
              by  simulating  send  requests  (see above) for the
              corresponding destinations.

              Delete empty per-destination logfiles that were not
              updated in <b>fast</b><i>_</i><b>flush</b><i>_</i><b>purge</b><i>_</i><b>delay</b> days.

       <b>FLUSH</b><i>_</i><b>REQ</b><i>_</i><b>PURGE</b> (completes in the background)
              Refresh  all non-empty per-destination logfiles, by
              simulating send requests (see above) for the corre-
              sponding  destinations.   This  can  be  incredibly
              expensive when caching is enabled for all  deferred
              mail, and is not recommended.

              Delete empty per-destination logfiles that were not
              updated in <b>fast</b><i>_</i><b>flush</b><i>_</i><b>purge</b><i>_</i><b>delay</b> days.

       Fast  flush  logfiles   are   truncated   only   after   a
       <b>FLUSH</b><i>_</i><b>REQ</b><i>_</i><b>SEND</b>  request,  not when mail is actually deliv-
       ered, and therefore can accumulate outdated  or  redundant
       data.  In order to maintain sanity, <b>FLUSH</b><i>_</i><b>REQ</b><i>_</i><b>REFRESH</b> must
       be executed periodically.

       The server response is one of:

       <b>FLUSH</b><i>_</i><b>STAT</b><i>_</i><b>OK</b>
              The request completed normally.

       <b>FLUSH</b><i>_</i><b>STAT</b><i>_</i><b>BAD</b>
              The flush server rejected the request (bad  request
              name, bad request parameter value).

       <b>FLUSH</b><i>_</i><b>STAT</b><i>_</i><b>FAIL</b>
              The request failed.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The  fast  flush server is not security-sensitive. It does
       not talk to the network, and it does  not  talk  to  local
       users.   The  fast  flush server can run chrooted at fixed
       low privilege.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       In reality, this server schedules delivery of all  recipi-
       ents of a deferred message.  This limitation is due to the
       fact that one queue runner has to handle mail for multiple



                                                                2

       <b>fast</b><i>_</i><b>flush</b><i>_</i><b>cache</b><i>_</i><b>policy</b>

              sponding destination.
