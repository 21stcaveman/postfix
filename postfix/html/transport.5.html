TRANSPORT(5)                                         TRANSPORT(5)

<b>NAME</b>
       transport - format of Postfix transport table

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postmap /etc/postfix/transport</b>

       <b>postmap -q "</b><i>string</i><b>" /etc/postfix/transport</b>

       <b>postmap -q - /etc/postfix/transport</b> &lt;<i>inputfile</i>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  optional  <b>transport</b>  table  specifies  a mapping from
       email addresses  to  message  delivery  transports  and/or
       relay hosts. The mapping is used by the <a href="trivial-rewrite.8.html"><b>trivial-rewrite</b>(8)</a>
       daemon.

       This mapping overrides the default routing that  is  built
       into Postfix:

       <b>mydestination</b>
              A  list of domains that is by default delivered via
              <b>$local_transport</b>.

       <b>virtual_mailbox_domains</b>
              A list of domains that is by default delivered  via
              <b>$virtual_transport</b>.

       <b>relay_domains</b>
              A  list of domains that is by default delivered via
              <b>$relay_transport</b>.

       any other destination
              Mail for any other destination is by default deliv-
              ered via <b>$default_transport</b>.

       Normally,  the <b>transport</b> table is specified as a text file
       that serves as  input  to  the  <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a>  command.   The
       result,  an  indexed file in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format, is used for
       fast searching by the mail  system.  Execute  the  command
       <b>postmap  /etc/postfix/transport</b>  in  order  to rebuild the
       indexed file after changing the transport table.

       When the table is provided via other means  such  as  NIS,
       LDAP  or  SQL,  the  same lookups are done as for ordinary
       indexed files.

       Alternatively, the table can be  provided  as  a  regular-
       expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
       sions, or lookups can be directed to TCP-based server.  In
       that  case,  the  lookups are done in a slightly different
       way as described below under "REGULAR  EXPRESSION  TABLES"
       and "TCP-BASED TABLES".

<b>TABLE FORMAT</b>
       The input format for the <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a> command is as follows:

       <i>pattern result</i>
              When  <i>pattern</i>  matches  the  recipient  address  or
              domain, use the corresponding <i>result</i>.

       blank lines and comments
              Empty  lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored,
              as are lines whose first  non-whitespace  character
              is a `#'.

       multi-line text
              A  logical  line starts with non-whitespace text. A
              line that starts with whitespace continues a  logi-
              cal line.

       The  <i>pattern</i> specifies an email address, a domain name, or
       a domain name hierarchy, as described  in  section  "TABLE
       LOOKUP".

       The  <i>result</i>  is of the form <i>transport</i><b>:</b><i>nexthop</i>.  The <i>trans-</i>
       <i>port</i> field specifies a mail  delivery  transport  such  as
       <b>smtp</b>  or  <b>local</b>. The <i>nexthop</i> field specifies where and how
       to deliver mail. More details are given in section "RESULT
       FORMAT".

<b>TABLE LOOKUP</b>
       With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
       networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or  SQL,  patterns  are
       tried in the order as listed below:

       <i>user+extension@domain transport</i>:<i>nexthop</i>
              Mail for <i>user+extension@domain</i> is delivered through
              <i>transport</i> to <i>nexthop</i>.

       <i>user@domain transport</i>:<i>nexthop</i>
              Mail for <i>user@domain</i> is delivered through <i>transport</i>
              to <i>nexthop</i>.

       <i>domain transport</i>:<i>nexthop</i>
              Mail  for  <i>domain</i> is delivered through <i>transport</i> to
              <i>nexthop</i>.

       <i>.domain transport</i>:<i>nexthop</i>
              Mail for  any  subdomain  of  <i>domain</i>  is  delivered
              through  <i>transport</i>  to  <i>nexthop</i>.  This applies only
              when the string <b>transport_maps</b> is not listed in the
              <b>parent_domain_matches_subdomains</b> configuration set-
              ting.  Otherwise, a domain name matches itself  and
              its subdomains.

       Note 1: the special pattern <b>*</b> represents any address (i.e.
       it functions as the wild-card pattern).

       Note 2:  the  null  recipient  address  is  looked  up  as
       <b>$empty_address_recipient</b>@<b>$myhostname</b> (default: mailer-dae-
       mon@hostname).

<b>RESULT FORMAT</b>
       The transport field specifies the name of a mail  delivery
       transport (the first name of a mail delivery service entry
       in the Postfix <b>master.cf</b> file).

       The interpretation  of  the  nexthop  field  is  transport
       dependent. In the case of SMTP, specify <i>host</i>:<i>service</i> for a
       non-default server port, and use [<i>host</i>] or [<i>host</i>]:<i>port</i>  in
       order  to  disable MX (mail exchanger) DNS lookups. The []
       form is required when you specify an IP address instead of
       a hostname.

       A  null  <i>transport</i>  and  null <i>nexthop</i> result means "do not
       change": use the delivery transport and  nexthop  informa-
       tion  that  would  be used when the entire transport table
       did not exist.

       A non-null <i>transport</i>  field  with  a  null  <i>nexthop</i>  field
       resets the nexthop information to the recipient domain.

       A  null  <i>transport</i>  field with non-null <i>nexthop</i> field does
       not modify the transport information.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       In order to deliver internal mail directly, while using  a
       mail  relay  for  all other mail, specify a null entry for
       internal destinations (do not change the  delivery  trans-
       port  or  the  nexthop information) and specify a wildcard
       for all other destinations.

            <b>my.domain    :</b>
            <b>.my.domain   :</b>
            <b>*         smtp:outbound-relay.my.domain</b>

       In order to send mail for <b>foo.org</b> and its  subdomains  via
       the <b>uucp</b> transport to the UUCP host named <b>foo</b>:

            <b>foo.org      uucp:foo</b>
            <b>.foo.org     uucp:foo</b>

       When  no  nexthop  host name is specified, the destination
       domain name is used instead. For  example,  the  following
       directs  mail for <i>user</i>@<b>foo.org</b> via the <b>slow</b> transport to a
       mail exchanger for <b>foo.org</b>.  The <b>slow</b> transport  could  be
       something  that  runs  at  most  one delivery process at a
       time:

            <b>foo.org      slow:</b>

       When no transport is specified, Postfix uses the transport
       that matches the address domain class (see TRANSPORT FIELD
       discussion above).   The  following  sends  all  mail  for
       <b>foo.org</b> and its subdomains to host <b>gateway.foo.org</b>:

            <b>foo.org      :[gateway.foo.org]</b>
            <b>.foo.org     :[gateway.foo.org]</b>

       In  the  above  example,  the  []  are used to suppress MX
       lookups.  The result would  likely  point  to  your  local
       machine.

       In  the  case  of delivery via SMTP, one may specify <i>host-</i>
       <i>name</i>:<i>service</i> instead of just a host:

            <b>foo.org      smtp:bar.org:2025</b>

       This directs mail for <i>user</i>@<b>foo.org</b> to  host  <b>bar.org</b>  port
       <b>2025</b>.  Instead  of a numerical port a symbolic name may be
       used. Specify [] around the hostname in order  to  disable
       MX lookups.

       The error mailer can be used to bounce mail:

            <b>.foo.org       error:mail for *.foo.org is not deliv-</b>
       <b>erable</b>

       This causes  all  mail  for  <i>user</i>@<i>anything</i><b>.foo.org</b>  to  be
       bounced.

<b>REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES</b>
       This  section  describes how the table lookups change when
       the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
       a  description  of regular expression lookup table syntax,
       see <a href="regexp_table.5.html"><b>regexp_table</b>(5)</a> or <a href="pcre_table.5.html"><b>pcre_table</b>(5)</a>.

       Each pattern is a regular expression that  is  applied  to
       the    entire    address    being    looked    up.   Thus,
       <i>some.domain.hierarchy</i> is not looked up up via  its  parent
       domains,  nor is <i>user+foo@domain</i> looked up as <i>user@domain</i>.

       Patterns are applied in the  order  as  specified  in  the
       table,  until  a  pattern is found that matches the search
       string.

       Results are the same as with indexed  file  lookups,  with
       the  additional feature that parenthesized substrings from
       the pattern can be interpolated as <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b> and so on.

<b>TCP-BASED TABLES</b>
       This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
       lookups are directed to a TCP-based server. For a descrip-
       tion  of  the  TCP  client/server  lookup  protocol,   see
       <a href="tcp_table.5.html"><b>tcp_table</b>(5)</a>.

       Each  lookup  operation  uses the entire recipient address
       once.  Thus, <i>some.domain.hierarchy</i> is not  looked  up  via
       its  parent  domains,  nor is <i>user+foo@domain</i> looked up as
       <i>user@domain</i>.

       Results are the same as with indexed file lookups.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       The following <b>main.cf</b> parameters are  especially  relevant
       to  this  topic.  See  the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file for syntax
       details and for default values.  Use  the  <b>postfix  reload</b>
       command after a configuration change.

       <b>empty_address_recipient</b>
              The  address  that is looked up instead of the null
              sender address.

       <b>parent_domain_matches_subdomains</b>
              List of Postfix features that use  <i>domain.tld</i>  pat-
              terns   to  match  <i>sub.domain.tld</i>  (as  opposed  to
              requiring <i>.domain.tld</i> patterns).

       <b>transport_maps</b>
              List of transport lookup tables.
