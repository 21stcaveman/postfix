<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The Postfix pgsql map type allows you to hook up Postfix to a
PostgreSQL database.  This implementation allows for multiple pgsql
databases: you can use one for a <a href="virtual.5.html">virtual(5)</a> table, one for an
<a href="access.5.html">access(5)</a> table, and one for an <a href="aliases.5.html">aliases(5)</a> table if you want.  You
can specify multiple servers for the same database, so that Postfix
can switch to a good database server if one goes bad.  </p>

<p> Busy mail servers using pgsql maps will generate lots of
concurrent pgsql clients, so the pgsql server(s) should be run with
this fact in mind. You can reduce the number of concurrent pgsql
clients by using the Postfix <a href="proxymap.8.html">proxymap(8)</a> service. </p>

<h2>Building Postfix with PostgreSQL support</h2>

<p> Note: to use pgsql with Debian GNU/Linux's Postfix, all you
need to do is to install the postfix-pgsql package and you're done.
There is no need to recompile Postfix. </p>

<p> In order to build Postfix with pgsql map support, you specify
-DHAS_PGSQL, the directory with the PostgreSQL header files, and
the location of the libpq library file. </p>

<p> For example: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
% make tidy
% make -f Makefile.init makefiles \
        'CCARGS=-DHAS_PGSQL -I/usr/local/include/pgsql' \
        'AUXLIBS=-L/usr/local/lib -lpq'
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Then just run 'make'.  </p>

<h2>Configuring PostgreSQL lookup tables</h2>

<p> Once Postfix is built with pgsql support, you can specify a
map type in main.cf like this: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    <a href="postconf.5.html#alias_maps">alias_maps</a> = <a href="PGSQL_README.html">pgsql</a>:/etc/postfix/pgsql-aliases.cf
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The file /etc/postfix/pgsql-aliases.cf specifies lots of
information telling postfix how to reference the pgsql database.
An example pgsql map config file follows: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
#
# pgsql config file for alias lookups on postfix
# comments are ok.
#

# the user name and password to log into the pgsql server
user = someone
password = some_password 

# the database name on the servers
dbname = customer_database

# the table name
table = mxaliases

# these should be obvious :-)
select_field = forw_addr
where_field = alias

# you may specify additional_conditions here
additional_conditions = and status = 'paid'

# the above variables will result in a query of the form: 
#
# select forw_addr from mxaliases where alias = '$lookup' and status = 'paid'
#
# ($lookup is escaped so if it contains single quotes or other odd
# characters, it will not cause a parse error in the sql).

# Alternatively, you can override the default SELECT statement (and the
# above table, select_field, where_field, and additional_conditions) by
# specifying the query:

#query = select forw_addr from mxaliases where alias = '%s' and status = 'paid'

# Before the query is actually issued, all occurences of %s are replaced
# with the address to look up, %u are replaced with the user portion,
# and %d with the domain portion.

# If you just want to use a PostgreSQL function, you can ignore the
# table name, select_field, where_field and additional_conditions, and
# just specify a database function to call:

#select_function = my_lookup_user_alias

# This is equivalent to:
#
#query = select my_lookup_user_alias('%s')
#
# and overrides both the query parameter and the table-related fields
# above.
#
# As of 25-Jun-2002, if the function returns a single row and a single
# column AND that value is NULL, then the result will be treated as
# if the key was not in the dictionary.
#
# Future versions of PG will allow functions to return result sets.

#
# The hosts that postfix will try to connect to and query from (in the
# order listed); specify unix: for unix-domain sockets, inet: for TCP
# connections (default)
hosts = host1.some.domain host2.some.domain unix:/file/name

# end pgsql config file
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Alternatively, these parameters can be defined in main.cf.  To
that effect, the map should be specified as "<a href="PGSQL_README.html">pgsql</a>:<i>name</i>",
and the parameters should be prefixed with the name you've given
the map in its definition, and an underscore.  For example, the
above settings can also be written in main.cf as: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# pgsql definitions in main.cf

<a href="postconf.5.html#alias_maps">alias_maps</a> = <a href="PGSQL_README.html">pgsql</a>:pgsqlsource

pgsqlsource_user = someone
pgsqlsource_password = some_password
pgsqlsource_dbname = customer_database
pgsqlsource_table = mxaliases
pgsqlsource_select_field = forw_addr
pgsqlsource_where_field = alias
pgsqlsource_additional_conditions = and status = 'paid'
# pgsqlsource_select_function = my_lookup_user_alias
pgsqlsource_hosts = host1.some.domain host2.some.domain unix:/file/name

# end pgsql definitions
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Using mirrored databases</h2>

<p> Sites that have a need for multiple mail exchangers may enjoy
the convenience of using a networked mailer database, but do not
want to introduce a single point of failure to their system.   </p>

<p> For this reason we've included the ability to have Postfix
reference multiple hosts for access to a single pgsql map.  This
will work if sites set up mirrored pgsql databases on two or more
hosts. </p>

<p> Whenever queries fail with an error at one host, the rest of
the hosts will be tried in order.  Each host that is in an error
state will undergo a reconnection attempt every so often, and if
no pgsql server hosts are reachable, then mail will be deferred
until at least one of those hosts is reachable. </p>

and Joshua Marcus, IC Group, Inc.

<li> The PostgreSQL changes were done by Aaron Sethman.

<li> Updates for Postfix 1.1.x and PostgreSQL 7.1+ and support for
calling stored procedures were added by Philip Warner.

<li> LaMont Jones was the initial Postfix pgsql maintainer.

<li> Liviu Daia revised the configuration interface and added the
main.cf configuration feature.
