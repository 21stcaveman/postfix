LOCAL(8)                                                 LOCAL(8)


<b>NAME</b>
       local - Postfix local mail delivery

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>local</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>local</b>  daemon  processes  delivery  requests from the
       Postfix queue manager to deliver mail to local recipients.
       Each  delivery  request  specifies  a queue file, a sender
       address, a domain or host to deliver to, and one  or  more
       recipients.   This program expects to be run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>mas-</b>
       <b>ter</b>(8)</a> process manager.

       The <b>local</b> daemon updates queue files and marks  recipients
       as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery
       should be tried again at a later  time.  Delivery  problem
       reports  are  sent  to the <a href="bounce.8.html"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a> or <a href="defer.8.html"><b>defer</b>(8)</a> daemon as
       appropriate.

<b>SYSTEM-WIDE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>USER-LEVEL</b> <b>ALIASING</b>
       The system adminstrator can set up one or more system-wide
       <b>sendmail</b>-style  alias databases.  Users can have <b>sendmail</b>-
       style ~/.<b>forward</b> files.  Mail for <i>name</i> is delivered to the
       alias  <i>name</i>,  to  destinations  in  ~<i>name</i>/.<b>forward</b>, to the
       mailbox owned by the user <i>name</i>, or  it  is  sent  back  as
       undeliverable.

       An  alias  or  ~/.<b>forward</b> file may list any combination of
       external  commands,  destination  file  names,   <b>:include:</b>
       directives,  or mail addresses.  See <a href="aliases.5.html"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> for a pre-
       cise description. Each line in a user's .<b>forward</b> file  has
       the same syntax as the right-hand part of an alias.

       When  an  address  is  found  in  its own alias expansion,
       delivery is made to the  user  instead.  When  a  user  is
       listed in the user's own ~/.<b>forward</b> file, delivery is made
       to the user's mailbox instead.  An empty  ~/.<b>forward</b>  file
       means do not forward mail.

       In  order  to prevent the mail system from using up unrea-
       sonable  amounts  of  memory,  input  records  read   from
       <b>:include:</b>  or  from  ~/.<b>forward</b>  files  are broken up into
       chunks of length <b>line</b><i>_</i><b>length</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>.

       While expanding aliases, ~/.<b>forward</b> files, and so on,  the
       program attempts to avoid duplicate deliveries. The <b>dupli-</b>
       <b>cate</b><i>_</i><b>filter</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b> configuration parameter limits the  num-
       ber of remembered recipients.

<b>MAIL</b> <b>FORWARDING</b>
       For  the sake of reliability, forwarded mail is re-submit-
       ted as a new message, so that each recipient has  a  sepa-
       rate on-file delivery status record.



                                                                1





LOCAL(8)                                                 LOCAL(8)


       In order to stop mail forwarding loops early, the software
       adds a <b>Delivered-To:</b> header with  the  envelope  recipient
       address.  If  mail arrives for a recipient that is already
       listed in a <b>Delivered-To:</b> header, the message is  bounced.

<b>MAILBOX</b> <b>DELIVERY</b>
       The  per-user mailbox is either a file in the default UNIX
       mailbox directory (<b>/var/mail/</b><i>user</i> or <b>/var/spool/mail/</b><i>user</i>)
       or  it  is a file in the user's home directory with a name
       specified via the  <b>home</b><i>_</i><b>mailbox</b>  configuration  parameter.
       Mailbox  delivery  can be delegated to an external command
       specified with the <b>mailbox</b><i>_</i><b>command</b>  configuration  parame-
       ter.

       The <b>local</b> daemon prepends a "<b>From</b> <i>sender</i> <i>time_stamp</i>" enve-
       lope header to  each  message,  prepends  a  <b>Delivered-To:</b>
       header  with  the envelope recipient address, prepends a &gt;
       character to lines beginning with "<b>From</b> ", and appends  an
       empty  line.   The  mailbox is locked for exclusive access
       while delivery is in progress. In  case  of  problems,  an
       attempt  is  made  to truncate the mailbox to its original
       length.

<b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>DELIVERY</b>
       The   <b>allow</b><i>_</i><b>mail</b><i>_</i><b>to</b><i>_</i><b>commands</b>    configuration    parameter
       restricts  delivery to external commands. The default set-
       ting (<b>alias,</b>  <b>forward</b>)  forbids  command  destinations  in
       <b>:include:</b> files.

       The  command  is  executed directly where possible. Assis-
       tance by the shell (<b>/bin/sh</b> on UNIX systems) is used  only
       when  the command contains shell magic characters, or when
       the command invokes a shell built-in command.

       A limited amount of command output  (standard  output  and
       standard  error) is captured for inclusion with non-deliv-
       ery status reports.  A command is forcibly  terminated  if
       it  does  not  complete within <b>command</b><i>_</i><b>time</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b> seconds.
       Command exit status codes are expected to follow the  con-
       ventions defined in &lt;<b>sysexits.h</b>&gt;.

       When mail is delivered on behalf of a user, the <b>HOME</b>, <b>LOG-</b>
       <b>NAME</b>, and <b>SHELL</b> environment variables are set accordingly.
       The <b>PATH</b> environment variable is always reset to a system-
       dependent default path, and the <b>TZ</b> (time zone) environment
       variable is always passed on without change.

       The current working directory is the mail queue directory.

       The <b>local</b> daemon prepends a "<b>From</b> <i>sender</i> <i>time_stamp</i>" enve-
       lope  header  to  each  message,  prepends a <b>Delivered-To:</b>
       header with the recipient envelope address, and appends an
       empty line.




                                                                2





LOCAL(8)                                                 LOCAL(8)


<b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>DELIVERY</b>
       The  <b>allow</b><i>_</i><b>mail</b><i>_</i><b>to</b><i>_</i><b>files</b> configuration parameter restricts
       delivery to external files. The  default  setting  (<b>alias,</b>
       <b>forward</b>) forbids file destinations in <b>:include:</b> files.

       The <b>local</b> daemon prepends a "<b>From</b> <i>sender</i> <i>time_stamp</i>" enve-
       lope header to  each  message,  prepends  a  <b>Delivered-To:</b>
       header  with  the recipient envelope address, prepends a &gt;
       character to lines beginning with "<b>From</b> ", and appends  an
       empty line.  When the destination is a regular file, it is
       locked for exclusive access while delivery is in progress.
       In case of problems, an attempt is made to truncate a reg-
       ular file to its original length.

<b>ADDRESS</b> <b>EXTENSION</b>
       The optional <b>recipient</b><i>_</i><b>delimiter</b>  configuration  parameter
       specifies  how  to  separate address extensions from local
       recipient names.

       For example, with  "<b>recipient</b><i>_</i><b>delimiter</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>+</b>",  mail  for
       <i>name</i>+<i>foo</i>  is  delivered  to  the  alias <i>name</i>+<i>foo</i> or to the
       alias <i>name</i>, to  the  destinations  listed  in  ~<i>name</i>/.<b>for-</b>
       <b>ward</b>+<i>foo</i> or in ~<i>name</i>/.<b>forward</b>, to the mailbox owned by the
       user <i>name</i>, or it is sent back as undeliverable.

       In all cases the <b>local</b> daemon  prepends  a  `<b>Delivered-To:</b>
       <i>name</i>+<i>foo</i>' header line.

<b>DELIVERY</b> <b>RIGHTS</b>
       Deliveries  to  external  files  and external commands are
       made with the rights of the receiving user on whose behalf
       the  delivery  is made.  In the absence of a user context,
       the <b>local</b> daemon uses the owner rights  of  the  <b>:include:</b>
       file or alias database.  When those files are owned by the
       superuser, delivery is made with the rights specified with
       the <b>default</b><i>_</i><b>privs</b> configuration parameter.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages)

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems  and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).  Cor-
       rupted message files are marked so that the queue  manager
       can move them to the <b>corrupt</b> queue afterwards.

       Depending  on the setting of the <b>notify</b><i>_</i><b>classes</b> parameter,
       the postmaster is notified of bounces and of  other  trou-
       ble.

<b>BUGS</b>
       For  security  reasons,  the  message  delivery  status of
       external commands or of external  files  is  never  check-
       pointed to file. As a result, the program may occasionally
       deliver more than once to  a  command  or  external  file.



                                                                3





LOCAL(8)                                                 LOCAL(8)


       Better safe than sorry.

       Mutually-recursive  aliases  or  ~/.<b>forward</b>  files are not
       detected early.  The resulting  mail  forwarding  loop  is
       broken by the use of the <b>Delivered-To:</b> message header.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The  following  <b>main.cf</b> parameters are especially relevant
       to this program. See the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file  for  syntax
       details  and  for  default  values. Use the <b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>
       command after a configuration change.
