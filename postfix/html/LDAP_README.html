<h2>LDAP Support in Postfix</h2>

<p> Postfix can use an LDAP directory as a source for any of its
lookups:  <a href="aliases.5.html">aliases(5)</a>, <a href="virtual.5.html">virtual(5)</a>, <a href="canonical.5.html">canonical(5)</a>, etc. This allows
you to keep information for your mail service in a replicated
network database with fine-grained access controls. By not storing
it locally on the mail server, the administrators can maintain it
from anywhere, and the users can control whatever bits of it you
think appropriate.  You can have multiple mail servers using the
same information, without the hassle and delay of having to copy
it to each. </p>

<h2><a name="build">Building Postfix with LDAP support</a></h2>

<p> Note 1: Postfix no longer supports the LDAP version 1 interface.
</p>

<p> Note 2: to use LDAP with Debian GNU/Linux's Postfix, all you
need is to install the postfix-ldap package and you're done.  There
is no need to recompile Postfix. </p>

<p> You need to have LDAP libraries and include files installed
somewhere on your system, and you need to configure the Postfix
Makefiles accordingly. </p>

<p> For example, to build the OpenLDAP libraries for use with
Postfix (i.e.  LDAP client code only), you could use the following
command: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
% ./configure  --without-kerberos --without-cyrus-sasl --without-tls \
    --without-threads --disable-slapd --disable-slurpd \
    --disable-debug --disable-shared
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> If you're using the libraries from the UM distribution
(<a href="http://www.umich.edu/~dirsvcs/ldap/ldap.html">http://www.umich.edu/~dirsvcs/ldap/ldap.html</a>) or OpenLDAP
(<a href="http://www.openldap.org">http://www.openldap.org</a>), something like this in the top level of
your Postfix source tree should work: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
% make tidy
% make makefiles CCARGS="-I/usr/local/include -DHAS_LDAP" \
    AUXLIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -lldap -L/usr/local/lib -llber"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> On Solaris 2.x you may have to specify run-time link information,
otherwise ld.so will not find some of the shared libraries: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
% make tidy
% make makefiles CCARGS="-I/usr/local/include -DHAS_LDAP" \
    AUXLIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib -lldap \
            -L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib -llber"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The 'make tidy' command is needed only if you have previously
built Postfix without LDAP support. </p>

<p> Instead of '/usr/local' specify the actual locations of your
LDAP include files and libraries. Be sure to not mix LDAP include
files and LDAP libraries of different versions!! </p>

<p> If your LDAP libraries were built with Kerberos support, you'll
also need to include your Kerberos libraries in this line. Note
that the KTH Kerberos IV libraries might conflict with Postfix's
lib/libdns.a, which defines dns_lookup. If that happens, you'll
probably want to link with LDAP libraries that lack Kerberos support
just to build Postfix, as it doesn't support Kerberos binds to the
LDAP server anyway. Sorry about the bother. </p>

<p> If you're using one of the Netscape LDAP SDKs, you'll need to
change the AUXLIBS line to point to libldap10.so or libldapssl30.so
or whatever you have, and you may need to use the appropriate linker
option (e.g. '-R') so the executables can find it at runtime. </p>

<h2><a name="config">Configuring LDAP lookups</a></h2>

<p> In order to use LDAP lookups, define at least one LDAP source
as a table lookup in main.cf, for example: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<a href="postconf.5.html#alias_maps">alias_maps</a> = hash:/etc/aliases, <a href="LDAP_README.html">ldap</a>:/etc/ldap-aliases.cf
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The file /etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf can specify the following
parameters. Defaults are given in parentheses. </p>

<p> Note: don't use quotes in these variables; at least, not until
the Postfix configuration routines understand how to deal with
quoted strings. </p>

<dl>

    <dt> server_host (default: localhost) </dt>

        <dd> <p> The name of the host running the LDAP server, e.g. </p>
        <blockquote>
                <tt>server_host = ldap.your.com</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p> It should be possible with all the libraries mentioned above
        to specify multiple servers, with the libraries trying them in
        order should the first one fail. It should also be possible to
        give each server in the list a different port, by naming them
        like "ldap.your.com:1444". </p>

        <p> With OpenLDAP, LDAP URLs can be used to request connection
        over UNIX domain sockets (ldapi://%2Fsome%2Fpath) or LDAP SSL
        (ldaps://ldap.your.com:636, provided OpenLDAP was compiled with
        support for SSL). </p>

    <dt>server_port (default: 389) </dt>

        <dd><p> The port the LDAP server listens on, e.g. </p>
        <blockquote>
                <tt>server_port = 778</tt>
        </blockquote>

    <dt>search_base (No default; you must configure this.) </dt>

        <dd><p> The <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2253.html">RFC2253</a> base DN at which to conduct the search, e.g. </p>
        <blockquote>
                <tt>search_base = dc=your, dc=com</tt>
        </blockquote>

    <dt>timeout (default: 10 seconds) </dt>

        <dd><p> The number of seconds a search can take before
        timing out, e.g. </p>
        <blockquote>
                <tt>timeout = 5</tt>
        </blockquote>
        
    <dt>query_filter (default: mailacceptinggeneralid=%s) </dt>

        <dd><p> The <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2254.html">RFC2254</a> filter used to search the directory,
        where %s is a substitute for the address Postfix is trying
        to resolve, e.g. </p>
        <blockquote>
                <tt>query_filter = (&amp;(mail=%s)(paid_up=true))</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p> This parameter supports the following '%' expansions: </p>

	<dl compact>

	<dt> %s </dt> 

	    <dd> This is replaced by the input key. <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2254.html">RFC 2254</a>
	    quoting is used to make sure that the input key does
	    not add unexpected metacharacters. </dd>
	
	<dt> %u </dt>

	    <dd> When the input key is an address of the form
	    user@domain, %u is replaced by the (<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2254.html">RFC 2254</a>) quoted
	    local part of the address.  if no domain is specified,
	    %u is replaced by the entire search string. </dd>

	<dt> %d </dt>

	    <dd> When the input key is an address of the form
	    user@domain, %d is replaced by the (<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2254.html">RFC 2254</a>) quoted
	    domain part of the address.  When the input key has no
	    domain qualifier, %d is replaced by the entire search
	    string. </dd>

	</dl>

	<p> The "<a name="#domain">domain</a>" parameter described
	below limits the input keys to addresses in matching domains.
	When the "domain" parameter is non-empty, LDAP queries for
	unqualified addresses or addresses in non-matching domains
	are suppressed and return no results. </p>

	<p> NOTE: DO NOT put double-quotes around the query filter
	</p> </dd>

    <dt>result_filter (default: %s) </dt>

        <dd><p> Format template applied to result attributes.
        Supports the same expansions as the query_filter, and can
        be easily used to append (or prepend) text. 
        </p>

	<p> This parameter supports the following '%' expansions:</p>

	<dl compact>

	<dt> %s </dt>

	    <dd> This is replaced by the value of the result
	    attribute. </dd>

	<dt> %u </dt>

	    <dd> When the result attribute is an address of
	    the form user@domain, %u is replaced local part of the
	    address, if the result attribute is unqualified, %u is
	    replaced by the entire attribute value. </dd>

	<dt> %d </dt>

	    <dd> When a result attribute is an address of the
	    form user@domain, %d is replaced by the domain part of
	    the attribute value.  If an attribute value is unqualified
	    %d is replaced by the entire attribute value. </dd>

	</dl>

	<p> For example, using "result_filter = <a href="smtp.8.html">smtp</a>:[%s]" allows
	one to use a mailHost attribute as the basis of a <a href="transport.5.html">transport(5)</a>
	table. After applying the result filter, multiple values
	are concatenated as comma separated strings. The expansion_limit
	and size_limit parameters explained below allow one to
	restrict the number of values in the result, which is
	especially useful for maps that should return a single
	value. </p>

	<p> The default value %s (no quotes!) specifies that each
	attribute value should be used as is. </p>

	<p> NOTE: DO NOT put double-quotes around the result filter!
	</p> </dd>

    <dt><a name="domain">domain</a> (default: no domain list.) </dt>

        <dd><p> This is a list of domain names, paths to files, or
        dictionaries.  When specified, only fully qualified search
        keys with a *non-empty* localpart and a matching domain
        are eligible for lookup: 'user' lookups, bare domain lookups
        and "@domain" lookups are not performed. This can significantly
        reduce the query load on the LDAP server. </p>
        <blockquote>
                <tt>domain = postfix.org, hash:/etc/postfix/searchdomains</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p> It is best not to use LDAP to store the domains eligible for LDAP
        lookups. </p>

    <dt>result_attribute (default: maildrop) </dt>

        <dd><p> The attribute(s) Postfix will read from any directory entries
        returned by the lookup, to be resolved to an email address. </p>

                <tt>result_attribute = mailbox,maildrop</tt>
        </blockquote>

    <dt>special_result_attribute (No default) </dt>

        <dd><p> The attribute(s) of directory entries that can

        <blockquote>
                <tt>special_result_attribute = member</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p> DN recursion retrieves the same result_attributes as
        the main query, including the special attributes for further
        recursion.  URI processing retrieves only those attributes
        that are included in the URI definition and are *also*
        listed in "result_attribute".  If the URI lists any of the
        map's special result attributes, these are also retrieved
        and used recursively. </p>

    <dt>scope (default: sub) </dt>

        <dd><p> The LDAP search scope: sub, base, or one. These
        translate into LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, LDAP_SCOPE_BASE, and
        LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL. </p>

    <dt>bind (default: yes) </dt>

        <dd><p> Whether or not to bind to the LDAP server. Newer
        LDAP implementations don't require clients to bind, which
        saves time. Example: </p>
        <blockquote>
                <tt>bind = no</tt>
        </blockquote>

        <p> If you do need to bind, you might consider configuring
        Postfix to connect to the local machine on a port that's
        an SSL tunnel to your LDAP server. If your LDAP server
        doesn't natively support SSL, put a tunnel (wrapper, proxy,
        whatever you want to call it) on that system too. This
        should prevent the password from traversing the network in
        the clear. </p>

    <dt>bind_dn (default: "") </dt>

        <dd><p> If you do have to bind, do it with this distinguished
        name.  Example: </p>
        <blockquote>
                <tt>bind_dn = uid=postfix, dc=your, dc=com</tt>
        </blockquote>

    <dt>bind_pw (default: "") </dt>

        <dd><p> The password for the distinguished name above. If
        you have to use this, you probably want to make the map
        configuration file readable only by the Postfix user. When
        using the obselete <a href="LDAP_README.html">ldap</a>:ldapsource syntax, with map parameters
        in main.cf, it is not possible to securely store the bind
        password. This is because main.cf needs to be world readable
        to allow local accounts to submit mail via the sendmail
        command. Example: </p>
        <blockquote>
                <tt>bind_pw = postfixpw</tt>
        </blockquote>

    <dt>cache        (IGNORED with a warning) </dt>
    <dt>cache_expiry (IGNORED with a warning) </dt>
    <dt>cache_size   (IGNORED with a warning) </dt>

        <dd><p> The above parameters are NO LONGER SUPPORTED by
        Postfix.  Cache support has been dropped from OpenLDAP as
        of release 2.1.13. </p>

    <dt>recursion_limit (default: 1000) </dt>

        <dd><p> A limit on the nesting depth of DN and URL special
        result attribute evaluation. The limit must be a non-zero
        positive number. </p>

    <dt>expansion_limit (default: 0) </dt>

        <dd><p> A limit on the total number of result elements
        returned (as a comma separated list) by a lookup against
        the map. A setting of zero disables the limit. Lookups fail
        with a temporary error if the limit is exceeded. Setting
        the limit to 1 ensures that lookups do not return multiple
        values. </p>

    <dt>size_limit (default: $expansion_limit) </dt>

        <dd><p> A limit on the number of LDAP entries returned by
        any single LDAP query performed as part of the lookup. A
        setting of 0 disables the limit. Expansion of DN and URL
        references involves nested LDAP queries, each of which is
        separately subjected to this limit. </p>

        <p> Note: even a single LDAP entry can generate multiple
        lookup results, via multiple result attributes and/or
        multi-valued result attributes. This limit caps the per
        query resource utilization on the LDAP server, not the
        final multiplicity of the lookup result. It is analogous
        to the "-z" option of "ldapsearch". </p>

    <dt>dereference (default: 0) </dt>

        <dd><p> When to dereference LDAP aliases. (Note that this
        has nothing do with Postfix aliases.) The permitted values
        are those legal for the OpenLDAP/UM LDAP implementations: </p>

<h2><a name="tls">LDAP SSL and STARTTLS</a></h2>

<p> If you're using the OpenLDAP libraries compiled with SSL support,
Postfix can connect to LDAP SSL servers and can issue the STARTTLS
command.  The first form can be requested by using a LDAP URL in
server_host: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
server_host = ldaps://ldap.your.com:636
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> STARTTLS can be turned on with the start_tls command: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
start_tls = yes
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Both forms require LDAP protocol version 3, which has to be
set explicitly: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
version = 3
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> If any of the Postfix programs querying the map is configured
in master.cf to run chrooted, all the certificates and keys involved
have to be copied to the chroot jail.  Of course, the private keys
should only be readable by the user "postfix". </p>

<p> The following commands are relevant to LDAP SSL and STARTTLS: </p> 

<dl>
       <dt>start_tls (default: no) </dt>
              <dd><p> Whether or not to issue STARTTLS upon connection to
              the server.  Don't set this with LDAP SSL. </p>

              by the CA subject name hash value, which must hence
              be available.  If more than one CA certificate with
              the same name hash value exist, the extension must
              be different (e.g. 9d66eef0.0, 9d66eef0.1 etc).  The
              search is performed in the ordering of the extension
              number, regardless of other properties of the
              certificates.  Use the c_rehash utility (from the
              OpenSSL distribution) to create the necessary links.

<h2><a name="compat">Backwards compatibility: LDAP configuration in main.cf</a> </h2>

<p> For backward compatibility, LDAP parameters can also be defined
in main.cf, prefixed with the name you've given the source in its
definition, and an underscore. For example, if the map is specified
as "<b><a href="LDAP_README.html">ldap</a>:ldapsource</b>", the first parameter above, "server_host",
would be defined in main.cf as "<b>ldapsource_</b>server_host".
Support for this form will be removed in a future Postfix version.
</p>

<h2><a name="example_alias">Example: aliases</a></h2>

<p> Here's a basic example for using LDAP to look up aliases. Assume
that in main.cf, you have: </p>

<blockquote> 
<pre>
<a href="postconf.5.html#alias_maps">alias_maps</a> = hash:/etc/aliases, <a href="LDAP_README.html">ldap</a>:/etc/ldap-aliases.cf
</pre>
</blockquote> 

<p> and in <a href="LDAP_README.html">ldap</a>:/etc/ldap-aliases.cf you have: </p>

<blockquote> 
<pre>
server_host = ldap.my.com
search_base = dc=my, dc=com
</pre>
</blockquote> 

<p> Upon receiving mail for a local address "ldapuser" that isn't
found in the /etc/aliases database, Postfix will search the LDAP
server listening at port 389 on ldap.my.com. It will bind anonymously,
search for any directory entries whose mailacceptinggeneralid
attribute is "ldapuser", read the "maildrop" attributes of those
found, and build a list of their maildrops, which will be treated
as <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC822</a> addresses to which the message will be delivered. </p>

<h2><a name="example_virtual">Example: virtual domains/addresses</a></h2>

<p> If you want to keep information for virtual lookups in your
directory, it's only a little more complicated. First you need to
make sure Postfix knows about the virtual domain. An easy way to
do that is to add the domain to the mailacceptinggeneralid attribute
of some entry in the directory. Next you'll want to make sure all
of your virtual recipients' mailacceptinggeneralid attributes are
fully qualified with their virtual domains. Finally, if you want
to designate a directory entry as the default user for a virtual
domain, just give it an additional mailacceptinggeneralid (or the
equivalent in your directory) of "@virtual.dom". That's right, no
user part. If you don't want a catchall user, omit this step and
mail to unknown users in the domain will simply bounce. </p>

<p> In summary, you might have a catchall user for a virtual domain
that looks like this: </p>

<blockquote> 
<pre>

<dl compact>

<dd> <p> 1: Postfix knows fake.dom is a valid virtual domain when
it looks for this and gets something (the maildrop) back. </p>

<dd> <p> 2: This causes any mail for unknown users in fake.dom to
go to this entry ... </p>

<dd> <p> 3: ... and then to its maildrop. </p>

</dl>

<p> Normal users might simply have one mailacceptinggeneralid and
maildrop, e.g. "normaluser@fake.dom" and "normaluser@real.dom".

<h2><a name="other">Other uses of LDAP lookups</a></h2>

Other common uses for LDAP lookups include rewriting senders and
recipients with Postfix' canonical lookups, for example in order to make
mail leaving your site appear to be coming from "First.Last@site.dom"
instead of "userid@site.dom".

<h2><a name="hmmmm">Notes and things to think about</a></h2>

<ul>

<li> <p> The bits of schema and attribute names used in this document are just
  examples. There's nothing special about them, other than that some are
  the defaults in the LDAP configuration parameters. You can use
  whatever schema you like, and configure Postfix accordingly. </p>

<li> <p> You probably want to make sure that mailacceptinggeneralids are
  unique, and that not just anyone can specify theirs as postmaster or
  root, say. </p>

<li> <p> An entry can have an arbitrary number of mailacceptinggeneralids or
  maildrops. Maildrops can also be comma-separated lists of addresses.
  They will all be found and returned by the lookups. For example, you
  could define an entry intended for use as a mailing list that looks
  like this (Warning! Schema made up just for this example): </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
dn: cn=Accounting Staff List, dc=my, dc=com
cn: Accounting Staff List
o: my.com
objectclass: maillist
mailacceptinggeneralid: accountingstaff
mailacceptinggeneralid: accounting-staff
maildrop: mylist-owner
maildrop: an-accountant
maildrop: some-other-accountant
maildrop: this, that, theother
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li> <p> If you use an LDAP map for lookups other than aliases, you may have to
  make sure the lookup makes sense. In the case of virtual lookups,
  maildrops other than mail addresses are pretty useless, because
  Postfix can't know how to set the ownership for program or file
  delivery. Your query_filter should probably look something like this: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
query_filter = (&amp;(mailacceptinggeneralid=%s)(!(|(maildrop="*|*")(maildrop="*:*")(maildrop="*/*"))))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li> <p> And for that matter, even for aliases, you may not want users able to
  specify their maildrops as programs, includes, etc. This might be
  particularly pertinent on a "sealed" server where they don't have
  local UNIX accounts, but exist only in LDAP and Cyrus. You might allow
  the fun stuff only for directory entries owned by an administrative
  account,
  so that if the object had a program as its maildrop and weren't owned
  by "cn=root" it wouldn't be returned as a valid local user. This will
  require some thought on your part to implement safely, considering the
  ramifications of this type of delivery. You may decide it's not worth
  the bother to allow any of that nonsense in LDAP lookups, ban it in
  the query_filter, and keep things like majordomo lists in local alias
  databases. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
query_filter = (&amp;(mailacceptinggeneralid=%s)(!(|(maildrop="*|*")(maildrop="*:*")(maildrop="*/*"))(owner=cn=root, dc=your, dc=com)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li> <p> LDAP lookups are slower than local DB or DBM lookups. For most sites
  they won't be a bottleneck, but it's a good idea to know how to tune
  your directory service. </p>

<li> <p> Multiple LDAP maps share the same LDAP connection if they differ
  only in their query related parameters: base, scope, query_filter, and
  so on. To take advantage of this avoid spurious differences in the
  definitions of LDAP maps: host selection order, version, bind, tls
  parameters, ... should be the same for multiple maps whenever possible. </p>

</ul>

include relevant information about your Postfix setup: LDAP-related
output from postconf, which LDAP libraries you built with, and which
directory server you're using. If your question involves your directory
contents, please include the applicable bits of some directory entries. </p>
