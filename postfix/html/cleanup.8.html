CLEANUP(8)                                             CLEANUP(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       cleanup - canonicalize and enqueue Postfix message

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>cleanup</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>cleanup</b> daemon processes inbound mail, inserts it into
       the <b>incoming</b> mail queue, and informs the queue manager  of
       its arrival.

       The <b>cleanup</b> daemon always performs the following transfor-
       mations:

       <b>o</b>      Insert missing message  headers:  (<b>Resent-</b>)  <b>From:</b>,
              <b>To:</b>, <b>Message-Id:</b>, and <b>Date:</b>.

       <b>o</b>      Extract envelope recipient addresses from (<b>Resent-</b>)
              <b>To:</b>, <b>Cc:</b> and <b>Bcc:</b> message headers when  no  recipi-
              ents are specified in the message envelope.

       <b>o</b>      Transform  envelope  and  header  addresses  to the
              standard <i>user@fully-qualified-domain</i> form  that  is
              expected  by  other Postfix programs.  This task is
              delegated to the <a href="trivial-rewrite.8.html"><b>trivial-rewrite</b>(8)</a> daemon.

       <b>o</b>      Eliminate duplicate envelope recipient addresses.

       The following address transformations are optional:

       <b>o</b>      Optionally,  rewrite  all   envelope   and   header
              addresses  according  to  the mappings specified in
              the <a href="canonical.5.html"><b>canonical</b>(5)</a> lookup tables.

       <b>o</b>      Optionally, masquerade  envelope  sender  addresses
              and  message  header  addresses (i.e. strip host or
              domain information below all domains listed in  the
              <b>masquerade_domains</b> parameter, except for user names
              listed  in  <b>masquerade_exceptions</b>).   By   default,
              address   masquerading  does  not  affect  envelope
              recipients.

       <b>o</b>      Optionally, expand envelope recipients according to
              information  found in the <a href="virtual.5.html"><b>virtual</b>(5)</a> lookup tables.

       The <b>cleanup</b> daemon performs sanity checks on  the  content
       of  each  message.  When it finds a problem, by default it
       returns a diagnostic status to the client, and  leaves  it
       up  to the client to deal with the problem. Alternatively,
       the client can request the <b>cleanup</b> daemon  to  bounce  the
       message back to the sender in case of trouble.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC 822</a> (ARPA Internet Text Messages)
       <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2045.html">RFC 2045</a> (MIME: Format of Internet Message Bodies)
       <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2046.html">RFC 2046</a> (MIME: Media Types)

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       Table-driven  rewriting  rules  make it hard to express <b>if</b>
       <b>then else</b> and other logical relationships.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       The following <b>main.cf</b> parameters are  especially  relevant
       to  this  program. See the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file for syntax
       details and for default values.  Use  the  <b>postfix  reload</b>
       command after a configuration change.

<b>Content filtering</b>
       <b>body_checks</b>
              Lookup tables with content filters for message body
              lines.  These filters see physical lines one  at  a
              time, in chunks of at most line_length_limit bytes.

       <b>body_checks_size_limit</b>
              The amount of content per message body segment that
              is subjected to <b>$body_checks</b> filtering.

       <b>header_checks</b>

       <b>mime_header_checks</b> (default: <b>$header_checks</b>)

       <b>nested_header_checks</b> (default: <b>$header_checks</b>)
              Lookup  tables  with  content  filters  for message
              header lines: respectively, these  are  applied  to
              the  primary  message  headers  (not including MIME
              headers), to the MIME headers anywhere in the  mes-
              sage,  and  to the initial headers of attached mes-
              sages.  These filters see logical headers one at  a
              time, including headers that span multiple lines.

<b>MIME Processing</b>
       <b>disable_mime_input_processing</b>
              While  receiving, give no special treatment to <b>Con-</b>
              <b>tent-Type:</b> message headers; all text after the ini-
              tial  message  headers  is considered to be part of
              the message body.

       <b>mime_boundary_length_limit</b>
              The amount of space that will be allocated for MIME
              multipart  boundary  strings. The MIME processor is
              unable to distinguish between boundary strings that
              do   not   differ   in   the   first   <b>$mime_bound-</b>
              <b>ary_length_limit</b> characters.

       <b>mime_nesting_limit</b>
              The maximal nesting level of  multipart  mail  that
              the  MIME processor can handle. Refuse mail that is
              nested deeper.

       <b>strict_8bitmime</b>
              Turn on both <b>strict_7bit_headers</b>  and  <b>strict_8bit-</b>
              <b>mime_body</b>.

       <b>strict_7bit_headers</b>
              Reject  mail  with  8-bit  text in message headers.
              This blocks mail from poorly written  applications.

       <b>strict_8bitmime_body</b>
              Reject  mail with 8-bit text in content that claims
              to be 7-bit, or in content  that  has  no  explicit
              content  encoding  information.   This  blocks mail
              from poorly written mail  software.  Unfortunately,
              this  also  breaks majordomo approval requests when
              the included  request  contains  valid  8-bit  MIME
              mail,  and  it  breaks bounces from mailers that do
              not properly encapsulate 8-bit content  (for  exam-
              ple,  bounces  from  qmail  or from old versions of
              Postfix).

       <b>strict_mime_domain_encoding</b>
              Reject mail with invalid <b>Content-Transfer-Encoding:</b>
              information  for  message/*  or  multipart/*.  This
              blocks mail from poorly written software.

<b>Miscellaneous</b>
       <b>always_bcc</b>
              Address to send a copy of each message that  enters
              the system.

       <b>sender_bcc_maps</b>
              Automatic  BCC  recipient  lookup table, indexed by
              sender address.  The BCC address is added when  the
              message enters the system.

       <b>recipient_bcc_maps</b>
              Automatic  BCC  recipient  lookup table, indexed by
              recipient address.  The BCC address is  added  when
              the message enters the system.

       <b>enable_original_recipient</b>
              Enable   support  for  the  <b>X-Original-To:</b>  message
              header, which is needed for  multi-recipient  mail-
              boxes.  When  this  is  enabled,  Postfix  performs
              duplicate  elimination  on   (original   recipient,
              rewritten  recipient)  pairs, instead of looking at
              the rewritten recipient only.

       <b>hopcount_limit</b>
              Limit the number of <b>Received:</b> message headers.

       <b>undisclosed_recipients_header</b>
              The header line that is inserted when no recipients
              were specified in (Resent-)To: or (Resent-)Cc: mes-
              sage headers.

<b>Address transformations</b>
       <b>empty_address_recipient</b>
              The destination for  undeliverable  mail  from  &lt;&gt;.
              This  substitution is done before all other address
              rewriting.

       <b>canonical_maps</b>
              Address mapping lookup table for sender and recipi-
              ent addresses in envelopes and headers.

       <b>recipient_canonical_maps</b>
              Address  mapping  lookup  table  for  envelope  and
              header recipient addresses.

       <b>sender_canonical_maps</b>
              Address  mapping  lookup  table  for  envelope  and
              header sender addresses.

       <b>masquerade_classes</b>
              List  of  address  classes subject to masquerading:
              zero or more of  <b>envelope_sender</b>,  <b>envelope_recipi-</b>
              <b>ent</b>, <b>header_sender</b>, <b>header_recipient</b>.

       <b>masquerade_domains</b>
              List  of  domains  that hide their subdomain struc-
              ture.

       <b>masquerade_exceptions</b>
              List of user names that are not subject to  address
              masquerading.

       <b>virtual_alias_maps</b>
              Address mapping lookup table for envelope recipient
              addresses.

<b>Resource controls</b>
       <b>duplicate_filter_limit</b>
              Limits the number of envelope recipients  that  are
              remembered.

       <b>header_address_token_limit</b>
              Limits the number of address tokens used to process
              a message header.

       <b>header_size_limit</b>
              Limits the amount of memory in bytes used to  store
              a message header.

       <b>in_flow_delay</b>
              Amount of time to pause before accepting a message,
              when the message arrival rate exceeds  the  message
              delivery rate.

       <b>virtual_alias_expansion_limit</b>
              Limit  the  number of actual recipients produced by
              virtual alias expansion from each original  recipi-
