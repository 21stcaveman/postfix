<h2> Introduction</h2>

Building a high-performance mail delivery system is one thing;
building one that does not knock over other systems is a different
story. Some mailers suffer from the <i>thundering herd</i> syndrome:
they literally flood other systems with mail. Postfix tries to be
a fast mailer and a good neighbor at the same time.

<p>

On the inbound side, the Postfix <a href="smtpd.8.html">SMTP
server</a> has defenses in place against malicious or confused
clients. They won't protect against an all-out denial of service
attack on your infrastructure, but then nothing will except pulling
the plug.

<p>

Unless indicated otherwise, all parameters described here are in
the <b>main.cf</b> file. If you change parameters of a running
Postfix system, don't forget to issue a <b>postfix reload</b>
command.

<ul>

<a href="#process">Process limits</a>

<p>

<a href="#destination">Destination concurrency</a>

<p>

<a href="#recipients">Recipient limits</a>

<p>

<a href="#postponing">Always postponing delivery</a>

<p>

<a href="#backoff">Backoff from dead hosts</a>

<p>

<a href="#hangup">Limiting the number of connections per client</a>

<p>

<a href="#slowdown">Slowing down bad clients</a>

</ul>

<a name="process"><h2> Process limits</h2></a>

The <b>default_process_limit</b> parameter (default: 100) gives
direct control over inbound and outbound delivery rates.  This
parameter controls the number of concurrent processes that implement
a Postfix service (smtp client, smtp server, local delivery, etc.).
On small systems, or on systems connected via dialup networks, a
<b>default_process_limit</b> of 10 is probably more than adequate.
Use a larger value if your machine is a major mail hub.

<p>

You can override this setting for specific Postfix daemons by
editing the <b>master.cf</b> file.  For example, if you do not
wish to receive 100 SMTP messages at the same time, you could specify:

<dl>

<dd> <pre> 
# ==========================================================================
# service type  private unpriv  chroot  wakeup  maxproc command + args
#               (yes)   (yes)   (yes)   (never) (100)
# ==========================================================================
. . .
smtp      inet  n       -       -       -       5       smtpd
. . .

</pre>

</dl>

<a name="destination"><h2> Destination concurrency</h2></a>

So, you have this huge mailhub with tons of disk and memory, and
have configured Postfix to run up to 1000 SMTP client processes at
the same time. Congratulations. But do you really want to make 1000
simultaneous connections to the same remote system? Probably not.

<p>

The Postfix queue manager comes to the rescue. This program implements
the analog of the TCP <i> slow start</i> flow control strategy:
when delivering to a site, send a small number of messages first,
then increase the rate as long as all goes well; back off in the
face of congestion.

<p>

The <b>initial_destination_concurrency</b> parameter (default:  2)
controls how many messages are initially sent to the same destination
before adapting delivery concurrency.  Of course, this setting is
effective only as long as it does not exceed the <b><a
href="#process">process limit</a></b> and the destination concurrency
limit for the specific mail transport channel.

<p>

The <b>default_destination_concurrency_limit</b> parameter
(default: 20) controls how many messages may be sent to the same
destination simultaneously. You can override this setting for
specific delivery channels (<b>local, smtp, uucp</b> etc.). The
<b>main.cf</b> file recommends the following:

<dl>

<dd> <b>local_destination_concurrency_limit = 2</b>

<dd> <b>default_destination_concurrency_limit = 20</b>

</dl>

The <b>local_destination_concurrency_limit</b> parameter controls
how many messages are delivered simultaneously to the same local
recipient.  The recommended limit is low because delivery to the
same mailbox must happen sequentially, so massive parallelism is
not useful.  Another good reason to limit delivery concurrency to
the same recipient:  if the recipient has an expensive shell command
in her <b>.forward </b> file, or if the recipient is a mailing list
manager, you don't want to run too many instances at the same time.

<p>

A destination concurrency limit of 20 for SMTP delivery seems enough
to noticeably load a system without bringing it to its knees. Be
careful when changing this to a much larger number.

<a name="recipients"><h2> Recipient limits</h2></a>

The <b>default_destination_recipient_limit</b> parameter (default:
50) controls how many recipients a Postfix delivery agent (<b>smtp</b>,
<b>uucp</b>, etc.) will send with each copy of an email message.
If an email message has more than
<b>$default_destination_recipient_limit</b> recipients at the same
destination, the list of recipients will be broken up into smaller lists,
and multiple copies of the message will be sent.

<p>

You can override this setting for specific Postfix delivery agents
(<b>smtp, uucp,</b> etc.). For example:

<dl>

<dd> <b>uucp_destination_recipient_limit = 100</b>

</dl>

would limit the number of recipients per <b>UUCP</b> delivery to 100.

<p>

You must be careful when increasing the recipient limit; some SMTP
servers abort the connection when they run out of memory or when
a hard recipient limit is reached, so the mail won't get through.

<p>

The <b>smtpd_recipient_limit</b> parameter (default: 1000)
controls how many recipients the SMTP server will take per delivery.
That's more than any reasonable SMTP client would send.  The limit
exists just to protect the local mail system against a malicious
or confused client.

<a name="postponing"><h2> Always postponing delivery</h2></a>

The <b>defer_transports</b> parameter allows you to specify what
mail should always be deferred until Postfix is explicitly asked
to deliver.

<p>

A small site that is on-line only part of the time, and
that wants to defer all deliveries until the command <b>sendmail
-q</b> is executed (e.g., from a PPP dialout script) would use:

<p>

<dl>

<dd><b>defer_transports = smtp</b>

</dl>

<p>

An ISP can use the <b>defer_transports</b> feature for customers
that are off-line most of the time. The customer can trigger delivery
by issuing an <b>ETRN</b> command at the SMTP port. The following
examples show how to configure such a customer:

<p>

<dl>

<dt>/etc/postfix/main.cf:

<p>

<dd><b>defer_transports = hold</b>

<p>

You can specify any number of transports here. The example gives
just one.

<p>

<dt>/etc/postfix/<a href="transport.5.html">transport</a>:

<p>

<dd><b>customer.com	&nbsp; hold:[gateway.customer.com]</b>

<dd><b>.customer.com	&nbsp; hold:[gateway.customer.com]</b>
 
<p>

The [] are necessary to avoid MX lookups, which might point to your
local machine.  The second entry is necessary only if you want to
relay mail for customer subdomains.  

<p>

<dt>/etc/postfix/master.cf:

<p>

<dd><b>hold &nbsp; unix &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; n &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; smtp</b>

<p>

This is just the <b>master.cf</b> entry for regular SMTP, with the
first field changed to <b>hold</b>.

</dl>

<a name="backoff"><h2> Backoff from unreachable hosts</h2></a>

When a Postfix delivery agent (<b>smtp, local, uucp,</b> etc.)
is unable to deliver a message it may blame the message itself or
the receiving party.

<ul>

<li> If the delivery agent blames the message, the queue manager
gives the queue file a time stamp into the future, so it won't be
looked at for a while. By default, the amount of time to cool down
is the amount of time that has passed since the message arrived.
This results in so-called <i>exponential backoff</i> behavior.

<p>

<li> If the delivery agent blames the receiving party (for example
a local recipient user, or a remote host), the queue manager not
only advances the queue file time stamp, but also puts the receiving
party on a "dead" list so that it will be skipped for some amount
of time.

</ul>

<p>

As you would expect, this whole process is governed by a bunch of
little parameters.

<dl>

<dt> <a name="queue_run_delay"> <b>queue_run_delay</b></a> (default:
1000 seconds) <dd> How often the queue manager scans the queue for
deferred mail.

<p>

<dt> <a name="maximal_queue_lifetime"> <b>maximal_queue_lifetime</b></a>
(default: 5 days) <dd> How long a message stays in the queue before
it is sent back as undeliverable. Specify 0 for mail that should
be returned immediately after the first unsuccessful delivery
attempt.

<p>

<dt> <a name="bounce_queue_lifetime"> <b>bounce_queue_lifetime</b></a>
(default: $maximal_queue_lifetime) <dd> How long a bounce message
stays in the queue before it is considered undeliverable. Specify
0 for mail that should be returned immediately after the first
unsuccessful delivery attempt.

<p>

<dt> <a name="minimal_backoff_time"> <b>minimal_backoff_time</b></a>
(default: 1000 seconds) <dd> The minimal amount of time a message
won't be looked at, and the minimal amount of time to stay away
from a "dead" destination.

<p>

<dt> <a name="maximal_backoff_time"> <b>maximal_backoff_time</b></a>
(default: 4000 seconds) <dd> The maximal amount of time a message
won't be looked at after a delivery failure.

<p>

<dt> <a name="qmgr_message_recipient_limit">
<b>qmgr_message_recipient_limit</b></a> (default: 20000) <dd> The
size of many in-memory queue manager data structures.  Among others,
this parameter limits the size of the short-term, in-memory "dead"
list.  Destinations that don't fit the list are not added.

</dl>

<a name="hangup"><h2>Limiting the number of connections per client</h2></a>

First of all, no Postfix defense will protect against an all-out
denial of service attack. I just don't want to raise impossible
expectations.  But there are a few simple things one can do in
order to deal with confused or malicious client programs.

<p>

The Postfix <a href="smtpd.8.html">SMTP server</a> can limit the
number of connections that an SMTP client is allowed to make,
simultaneously or within an interval of time.  The configuration
parameters that control this are:

<p>

<dl>

<dt> <a name="smtpd_client_connection_count_limit">
<b>smtpd_client_connection_count_limit</b></a> (default: 50) <dd>
An upper bound on the number of simultaneous connections that an
SMTP client is allowed to make. When a client exceeds the limit
Postfix replies with a 421 status code and breaks the connection.
To avoid wasting time, specify <b>smtpd_error_sleep_time = 0</b>.

<p>

<dt> <a name="smtpd_client_connection_rate_limit">
<b>smtpd_client_connection_rate_limit</b></a> (default: unlimited)
<dd> An upper bound on the number of subsequent connections that
an SMTP client is allowed to make per unit time. When a client
exceeds the limit Postfix replies with a 421 status code and breaks
the connection. To avoid wasting time, specify <b>smtpd_error_sleep_time
= 0</b>.

<p>

<dt> <a name="smtpd_client_connection_limit_exceptions">
<b>smtpd_client_connection_limit_exceptions</b></a> (default:
<b>$mynetworks</b>) <dd> A description of SMTP clients that are
excluded from connection count and rate limits. By default,
local or trusted clients are excluded.

<p>

<dt> <a name="client_rate_time_unit"> <b>client_rate_time_unit</b></a>
(default: 60s) <dd> The time unit for computing the client connection
and other rates.

</dl>


<a name="slowdown"><h2> Slowing down bad clients</h2></a>

The Postfix <a href="smtpd.8.html">SMTP server</a> increments a
per-session error counter whenever a client request is unrecognized
or unimplemented, whenever a client request violates <a
href="uce.html">UCE restrictions</a>, or for other reasons that
cause Postfix to report an error of some kind.  The error counter
is reset after a message is transferred successfully.

<p>

As the per-session error count increases, the SMTP server changes
behavior and inserts delays before responding.  The idea is to
limit the damage by slowing down the client. The downside is that
this ties up Postfix resources that can no longer be used by
legitimate clients.  Sites that are concerned about performance
may want to turn off the delays altogether.

<p>

The behavior is controlled by the following parameters:

<p>

<dl>

<dt> <a name="smtpd_error_sleep_time"> <b>smtpd_error_sleep_time</b></a>
(default: 1 second) <dd> When the per-session error count is small,
the SMTP server pauses only when reporting a problem to a client.
The purpose is to prevent naive clients from going into a fast
<i>connect-error-disconnect</i> loop.

<p>

<dt> <a name="smtpd_soft_error_limit"> <b>smtpd_soft_error_limit</b></a>
(default: 10) <dd> When the per-session error count exceeds this
value, the SMTP server sleeps <b>error_count</b> seconds before
responding to a client request.

<p>


<dt> <a name="smtpd_hard_error_limit"> <b>smtpd_hard_error_limit</b></a>
(default: 20) <dd> When the per-session error count exceeds this
value, the SMTP server disconnects.

</dl>
