ACCESS(5)                                               ACCESS(5)


<b>NAME</b>
       access - format of Postfix access table

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/access</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  optional <b>access</b> table directs the Postfix SMTP server
       to selectively reject or accept mail from or  to  specific
       hosts,   domains,   networks,   host   addresses  or  mail
       addresses.

       Normally, the table serves as input to the <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a> com-
       mand.  The result, an indexed file in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format, is
       used for fast searching  by  the  mail  system.  After  an
       update  it  may  take  a  minute  or  so before the change
       becomes visible.  Issue a <b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b> command to elimi-
       nate the delay.

       When  the  table  is provided via other means such as NIS,
       LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are  done  as  for  ordinary
       indexed files.

       Alternatively,  the  table  can  be provided as a regular-
       expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
       sions.  In  that  case, the lookups are done in a slightly
       different way as described below.

<b>TABLE</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
       The format of the access table is as follows:

       blanks and comments
              Blank lines are ignored,  as  are  lines  beginning
              with `#'.

       <i>pattern</i> <i>action</i>
              When <i>pattern</i> matches a mail address, domain or host
              address, perform the corresponding <i>action</i>.

<b>PATTERNS</b>
       With lookups from indexed files, patterns are tried in the
       order as listed below:

       <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>
              Matches the specified mail address.

       <i>domain.name</i>
              Matches  the  <i>domain.name</i>  itself and any subdomain
              thereof, either in hostnames or in mail  addresses.
              Top-level domains will never be matched.

       <i>user</i>@  Matches  all mail addresses with the specified user
              part.




                                                                1





ACCESS(5)                                               ACCESS(5)


       <i>net.work.addr.ess</i>

       <i>net.work.addr</i>

       <i>net.work</i>

       <i>net</i>    Matches any host address in the specified  network.
              A  network  address  is  a  sequence of one or more
              octets separated by ".".

<b>ACTIONS</b>
       [<b>45</b>]<i>XX</i> <i>text</i>
              Reject the address etc. that matches  the  pattern,
              and respond with the numerical code and text.

       <b>REJECT</b> Reject the address etc. that matches the pattern. A
              generic error response message is generated.

       <b>OK</b>

       <i>Any</i> <i>other</i> <i>text</i>
              Accept the address etc. that matches the pattern.

<b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>TABLES</b>
       This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
       the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
       a description of regular expression lookup  table  syntax,
       see <b>regexp</b><i>_</i><b>table</b>(5) or <b>pcre</b><i>_</i><b>table</b>(5).

       Patterns  become  regular  expressions that are applied to
       the entire string being looked up. Depending on the appli-
       cation,  that  string  is  an  entire  client hostname, an
       entire client IP address, or an entire mail address.

       In contrast to the normal lookups from indexed  files,  no
       parent  domain  or network search is done, and <i>user@domain</i>
       mail addresses are not broken  up  into  their  <i>user@</i>  and
       <i>domain</i> constituent parts.

       Actions  are the same as with normal indexed file lookups,
       with the additional feature that parenthesized  substrings
       from  the pattern can be interpolated as <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b> and so on.

<b>BUGS</b>
       The table format does not understand quoting  conventions.
