POSTLOGD(8)                                                        POSTLOGD(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       postlogd - Postfix internal log server

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postlogd</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This program logs events on behalf of Postfix programs when the maillog
       configuration parameter specifies a non-empty value.

<b>BUGS</b>
       Non-daemon Postfix programs don't know that  they  should  log  to  the
       internal  logging  service until after they have processed command-line
       options and <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> parameters. These programs still log earlier events
       to the syslog service.

       If Postfix is down, then logging from non-daemon programs will be lost,
       except for logging from the <a href="postfix.1.html">postfix(1)</a> and <a href="postlog.1.html">postlog(1)</a>  commands.  These
       can log directly to file when running as root, for example during Post-
       fix start-up.

       Non-daemon Postfix programs can talk to <b>postlogd</b>(8) only  if  they  are
       run  by  the super-user, or if their executable files have set-gid per-
       mission.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       Changes to <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>main.cf</b></a> are picked up  automatically,  as  <b>postlogd</b>(8)  pro-
       cesses  run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command "<b>postfix</b>
       <b>reload</b>" to speed up a change.

       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See  <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>postconf</b>(5)</a>  for

              records, so that, for example, "smtpd" becomes "prefix/smtpd".
