ANVIL(8)                                                 ANVIL(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       anvil - Postfix per-client count and rate control

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>anvil</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  Postfix  <b>anvil</b> server maintains short-term statistics
       to defend against clients that hammer a server with either
       too  many parallel connections or with too many successive
       requests within a configurable time interval.  This server
       is  designed  to  run  under control by the Postfix master
       server.

       The <b>anvil</b> server maintains no persistent  database.  Stan-
       dard library utilities do not meet Postfix performance and
       robustness requirements.

<b>CONNECTION COUNT/RATE LIMITING</b>
       When a remote client  connects,  a  connection  count  (or
       rate)  limited server should send the following request to
       the <b>anvil</b> server:

           <b>request=connect</b>
           <b>ident=</b><i>string</i>

       This registers a new connection for the (service,  client)
       combination specified with <b>ident</b>. The <b>anvil</b> server answers
       with the number of simultaneous connections and the number
       of  connections  per  unit time for that (service, client)
       combination:

           <b>status=0</b>
           <b>count=</b><i>number</i>
           <b>rate=</b><i>number</i>

       The <b>rate</b> is computed as the  number  of  connections  that
       were  registered  in the current "time unit" interval.  It
       is left up to the server to decide if  the  remote  client
       exceeds the connection count (or rate) limit.

       When  a  remote client disconnects, a connection count (or
       rate) limited server should send the following request  to
       the <b>anvil</b> server:

           <b>request=disconnect</b>
           <b>ident=</b><i>string</i>

       This  registers  a  disconnect  event  for  the  (service,
       client) combination specified with <b>ident</b>. The <b>anvil</b> server
       replies with:

           <b>status=0</b>

<b>MESSAGE RATE LIMITING</b>
       When  a  remote client sends a message delivery request, a
       message rate limited  server  should  send  the  following
       request to the <b>anvil</b> server:

           <b>request=message</b>
           <b>ident=</b><i>string</i>

       This  registers  a  message delivery request for the (ser-
       vice, client) combination specified with <b>ident</b>. The  <b>anvil</b>
       server   answers  with  the  number  of  message  delivery
       requests per unit time for that (service, client) combina-
       tion:

           <b>status=0</b>
           <b>rate=</b><i>number</i>

       In  order  prevent the anvil server from discarding client
       request rates too early or too late, a message  rate  lim-
       ited   service  should  also  register  connect/disconnect
       events.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>RECIPIENT RATE LIMITING</b>
       When a remote client sends a recipient address, a  recipi-
       ent  rate limited server should send the following request
       to the <b>anvil</b> server:

           <b>request=recipient</b>
           <b>ident=</b><i>string</i>

       This registers  a  recipient  address  for  the  (service,
       client) combination specified with <b>ident</b>. The <b>anvil</b> server
       answers with the number of recipient  addresses  per  unit
       time for that (service, client) combination:

           <b>status=0</b>
           <b>rate=</b><i>number</i>

       In  order  prevent the anvil server from discarding client
       request rates too early or too late, a recipient rate lim-
       ited   service  should  also  register  connect/disconnect
       events.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The <b>anvil</b> server does not talk to the network or to  local
       users, and can run chrooted at fixed low privilege.

       The  <b>anvil</b> server maintains an in-memory table with infor-
       mation about recent clients  of  a  connection  count  (or
       rate)  limited  service.  Although state is kept only tem-
       porarily, this may require a lot of memory on systems that
       handle  connections  from  many remote clients.  To reduce
       memory usage, reduce the time unit  over  which  state  is
       kept.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

       Upon exit, and every <b><a href="postconf.5.html#anvil_status_update_time">anvil_status_update_time</a></b> seconds, the
       server logs the maximal count and  rate  values  measured,
       together  with  (service, client) information and the time
       of day associated with those events.  In  order  to  avoid
       unnecessary  overhead, no measurements are done for activ-
       ity that isn't concurrency limited or rate limited.

<b>BUGS</b>
       Systems behind  network  address  translating  routers  or
       proxies appear to have the same client address and can run
       into connection count and/or rate limits falsely.

       In this preliminary implementation, a count (or rate) lim-
       ited  server can have only one remote client at a time. If
       a server reports multiple simultaneous  clients,  all  but
       the last reported client are ignored.
