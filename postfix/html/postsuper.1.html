POSTSUPER(1)                                         POSTSUPER(1)


<b>NAME</b>
       postsuper - Postfix super intendent

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postsuper</b> [<b>-d</b> <i>queue_id</i>] [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-s</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<i>directory</i> <i>...</i>]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>postsuper</b>  command does small maintenance jobs on the
       named Postfix queue directories (default: all).  Directory
       names  are  relative to the Postfix top-level queue direc-
       tory.

       By default, <b>postsuper</b> performs  the  operations  requested
       with the <b>-s</b> and <b>-p</b> command-line options.  <b>postsuper</b> always
       tries to remove objects that are neither files nor  direc-
       tories.   Use  of this command is restricted to the super-
       user.

       Options:

       <b>-d</b>     Delete one message queue file with the named  queue
              ID.  Specify multiple <b>-d</b> options to delete multiple
              queue files by name.

              Alternatively, if a <i>queue_id</i> of <b>-</b> is specified, the
              program reads queue IDs from standard input.

              This  operation  can  be performed safely while the
              mail system is running, although the queue  manager
              may issue warnings when a file suddenly disappears.
              The exit status is zero if  at  least  one  of  the
              named message queue files was found.

       <b>-s</b>     Structure  check.  Move queue files that are in the
              wrong place in the file system hierarchy and remove
              subdirectories  that  are  no  longer  needed. File
              rearrangements are necessary after a change in  the
              <b>hash</b><i>_</i><b>queue</b><i>_</i><b>names</b> and/or <b>hash</b><i>_</i><b>queue</b><i>_</i><b>depth</b> configura-
              tion parameters. It is highly  recommended  to  run
              this check once before Postfix startup.

       <b>-p</b>     Purge  stale  files (files that are left over after
              system or software crashes).

       <b>-v</b>     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Mul-
              tiple  <b>-v</b>  options  make  the software increasingly
              verbose.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems are reported to the standard error stream and  to
       <b>syslogd</b>.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
