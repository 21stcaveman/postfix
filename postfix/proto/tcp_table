# NAME
#	tcp_table 5
# SUMMARY
#	Postfix client/server table lookup protocol
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap -q "\fIstring\fB" tcp:\fIhost:port\fR
#
#	\fBpostmap -q - regexp:\fIhost:port\fR <\fIinputfile\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#       The Postfix mail system uses optional tables for address
#       rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in
#       \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format. Alternatively, lookup tables
#       can be specified as a TCP client/server pair.
#
#       To find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix system
#       supports use the \fBpostconf -m\fR command.
#
#       To test lookup tables, use the \fBpostmap\fR command as
#       described in the SYNOPSIS above.
# PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION
# .ad
# .fi
#	The TCP map class implements a very simple protocol: the client
#	sends a request, and the server sends one reply. Requests and
#	replies are sent as one line of ASCII text, terminated by the
#	ASCII newline character. Request and reply parameters (see below)
#	are separated by whitespace.
# ENCODING
# .ad
# .fi
#	In request and reply parameters, the character % and any non-printing
#	and whitespace characters must be replaced by %XX, XX being the
#	corresponding ASCII hexadecimal character value. The hexadecimal codes
#	can be specified in any case (upper, lower, mixed).
# REQUEST FORMAT
# .ad
# .fi
#	Requests are strings that serve as lookup key in the simulated
#	table.
# .IP "\fBget\fR SPACE \fIkey\fR NEWLINE"
#	Look up data under the specified key.
# .IP "\fBput\fR SPACE \fIkey\fR SPACE \fIvalue\fR NEWLINE"
#	This request is currently not implemented.
# REPLY FORMAT
# .ad
# .fi
#      Replies must be no longer than 4096 characters including the
#	newline terminator, and must have the following form:
# .IP "\fB500\fR SPACE \fIoptional-text\fR NEWLINE"
#	In case of a lookup request, the requested data does not exist.
#	In case of an update request, the request was rejected.
# .IP "\fB400\fR SPACE \fIoptional-text\fR NEWLINE"
#	This indicates an error condition. The text gives the nature of
#	the problem. The client should retry the request later.
# .IP "\fB200\fR SPACE \fItext\fR NEWLINE"
#	The request was successful. In the case of a lookup request,
#	the text contains an encoded version of the requested data.
#	Otherwise the text is optional.
# SEE ALSO
#	regexp_table(5) format of regular expression tables
#	pcre_table(5) format of PCRE tables
#	cidr_table(5) format of CIDR tables
# BUGS
#	Only the lookup method is currently implemented.
